## 6.2.2 Primitives {-}

:::question
So if you are familiar with C can you just write a function in C *in* R? What does that process look like? I think this is a bigger question of digging into the relationship between C and R.
:::

We can use RCPP!

```{r}
Rcpp::cppFunction('#include<string>
  std::string IPA() {
  std::string val = "IPAs suck";	
  return val;
  }')
val <- IPA()
val
```

1. __[Q]{.Q}__: Given a name, like `"mean"`, `match.fun()` lets you find a function. Given a function, can you find its name? Why doesn't that make sense in R?

    __[A]{.started}__: A name can only point to a single object, but an object can be pointed to by 0, 1, or many names. What are names of the functions in the following block?

    ```{r}
  function(x) sd(x) / mean(x)
    
  f1 <- function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
  f2 <- f1
  f3 <- f1

## 6.3 Function composition {-}

:::question
When comparing nested, intermediate, and piping functions, it looks like Hadley flips the order of `f()` and `g()` between bullet points
:::

It does look like he does that!


```{r}
f <- function(z) {
  cat("g is:", z)
}

g <- function(x) {
  x * 2
}
```

### Nested

```{r}
f(g(2))
```

### Intermediate 

This is written in the book as `y <- f(x); g(y)` but should be flipped to `y <- g(x); f(y)` if we are to follow the nested example

```{r}
y <- g(2)
f(y)
```

### Piping

This also needs to be flipped from `x %>% f() %>% g()` to `x %>% g() %>% f()`

```{r}
2 %>% g() %>% f()
```


## 6.4 Lexical scoping {-}

:::question
"The scoping rules use a parse-time, rather than a run-time structure"? What is "parse-time" and "run-time"? How do they differ?
:::

parse-time is when the function gets defined: when the formals and body get set. run-time is when it actually gets called. This function doesn't get past parse-time because of the syntax error

```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_state <- function(in_df, state_name){
  out_df % in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ]
  return(out_df)
}
```

```
get_state <- function(in_df, state_name){
  out_df % in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ]

Error: unexpected input in:

"get_state <- function(in_df, state_name){
  out_df % in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ]"
  return(out_df)

Error: object 'out_df' not found
}

Error: unexpected '}' in "}"
```

This function will get parsed successfully but could fail at run at run-time if the input data frame doesn't have a column named state:

```{r}
get_state <- function(in_df, state_name){
  out_df <- in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ]
  return(out_df)
}  

get_state(iris, 'setosa')
```

At R's build-time, if you want to run a function from a package that isn't loaded it will not throw an error but at run-time it will if the required package is not loaded:

```{r}
func_1 <- function(df, x) {
  select({{ df }}, {{ x }})
}

test_tbl <- tibble::tibble(x1 = runif(5),
             x2 = rnorm(5),
             x3 = rpois(5, lambda = 1))
```

Without `dplyr` this will fail
```{r, eval=FALSE}
func_1(test_tbl, x1)
```

```
Error in select({: could not find function "select"
```

This will work:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
func_1(test_tbl, x1)
```


## 6.4.3 A fresh start {-}

:::question
How would we change this code so that the second call of `g11()` is 2?

```{r}
g11 <- function() {
  if (!exists("a")) {
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  a
}

g11()
```
:::

```{r}
g11 <- function() {
  if (!exists("a")) {
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  a <<- a
  a
}

g11()
```


##  6.5 Lazy evaluation {-}

:::question
"This allows you to do things like include potentially expensive computations in function arguments that will only be evaluated if needed"

Does anyone have an example of this? We discussed a function that will only perform expensive tasks given the context of the function perhaps?
:::

Maybe a situation where we can give a function default arguments where `sample`is a stand in for longer expensive functions like different fancy modeling techniques? We can workshop this...

```{r}
mega_model <- function(values, x = sample(1:100, 10), y = sample(200:300, 10), z = sample(300:400, 10)
) {
  dplyr::case_when(
    is.numeric(values) ~ x,
    is.character(values) ~ y,
    TRUE ~ z
  )
}

mega_model(c("a", "b", "c"))
```



## 6.5.1 Promises {-}

:::question
Can we discuss the order that this happening in? Is it that `Calculating...` is printed, then `x*2` then `x*2` again? I am still reading this as: `h03(double(20), double(20))` which is an incorrect mental model because the message is only printed once...

```{r}
double <- function(x) { 
  message("Calculating...")
  x * 2
}

h03 <- function(x) {
  c(x, x)
}
```
:::


:::TODO

Still need to work on explaining what's happening here and what that would look like graphically:

```{r}
double <- function(y) {
  message("Calculating...")
  cat("double before\n")
  print(pryr::promise_info(y))
  force(y)
  cat("double after\n")
  print(pryr::promise_info(y))
  y * 2
}
h03 <- function(x) {
  cat(paste0("h03 before\n"))
  print(pryr::promise_info(x))
  force(x)
  cat("h03 after\n")
  print(pryr::promise_info(x))
  c(x, x)
}
double(h03(20))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/promise.png")
```
:::


:::question
```{r}
plop <- function(a, b) a * 10
plop(2, var_doesnt_exist)
```

`var_doesnt_exist` is a promise within `g`, we use the promises within `g` when we call `f` but `f` never uses its second argument so this runs without a problem. When would we want to leverage this behavior?
:::

The unevaluated `var_doesnt_exist` doesnâ€™t exist , but we can use `substitute` to to get the expression out of a promise! If we modify our function we can play with the expression contained in b:

```{r}
plop <- function(a, b) {
  cat("You entered", deparse(substitute(b)), "as `b` \n")
  a * 10
}
plop(a = 2, b = var_doesnt_exist)
```

We can even evaluate `b` and use it to create a `dplyr` like `pull` function:

```{r}
plop <- function(a, b) {
  eval(substitute(b), envir = a)
}
plop(iris, Species)[1:10]
```


## 6.5.2 Default arguments {-}

:::question
I don't quite understand why `x = ls()` is different from `ls()` here; aren't we still assigning `x = ls()` but without specifying x?
```{r}
h05 <- function(x = ls()) {
  a <- 1
  x
}

# this makes sense to me
h05()
# how is this different from above?
h05(ls())
```
:::

The difference is where the promise is created. `ls()` is always evaluated inside `h05` when `x` is evaluated. The difference is the environment. When `ls()` is provided as an explicit parameter, `x` is a promise whose environment is the global environment. When `ls()` is a default parameter, it is evaluated in the local environment where it is used.

Hypothesis: does nesting `ls()` in `h05` first evaluate `ls()` then evaluate `h05()` ?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
h05 <- function(x = {y <- 4;ls()}) {
   a <- 1
   x
}
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
h05()
```

```
[1] "a" "x" "y"
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls()
```

```
[1] "h05"
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
{y <- 4;ls()} %>% h05()
```

```
[1] "h05" "y"  
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls()
```

```
[1] "h05" "y" 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
h05({x <- 5;ls()})
```

```
[1] "h05" "x"   "y" 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls()
```
```
[1] "h05" "x"   "y" 
```

Notice in all of the latter calls, a is not returned - so it's not evaluating `ls()` inside of the function.

## 6.5.4.3 Exercise {-}

:::question

I understand this problem is showing us an example of name masking (the function doesn't need to use the `y = 0` argument because it gets `y` from within the definition of x, but I'm fuzzy on what exactly the `;` does. What does the syntax `{y <- 1; 2}` mean? Could it be read as "Set `y <- 1` and `x <- 2`?

```{r}
y <- 10
f1 <- function(x = {y <- 1; 2}, y = 0) {
  c(x, y)
}
f1()
```
:::

The curly brackets are an expression, which can be read as 

```{r}
{
  y <- 1
  2
}
```

This is returning `2` and setting `1` to `y`. The colon can be read as a new line in the expression. `x` is called inside the function and overwrites the argument value of `y`

```{r}
f1 <- function(x = {y <- 1; 2}, y = 0) {
  # At this point, neither x nor y have been needed or evaluated. This is "lazy".
  cat(y) 
  # "Summon the current state of y". 
  # R looks first in the function env - is there a y there? No
  # R then looks at the arguments - is there a y there? Yes, it's 0 -> print out zero 
  # If R had not found y in the arguments, then it would look in the parent environment of the function - the global env.
  # That's where it would find y = NULL - but since it already found a default arg, it already stopped evaluating. 
  cat(x)
  # "Summon the current state of x"
  # x is an expression that first sets y to equal 1 and then returns the number 2 -> print out 2
  c(x, # "Summon the current state of x" - x is still the expression that sets y to 1 and then x to 2
    y) # "Summon the current state of y" - y was set to 1, so y is 1 here.
}
f1()
```

Compare to:

```{r}
f1 <- function(x = {y <- 1; 2}, y = 0) {
  c(y, # "Summon the current state of y" - y has not yet been set to anything else, so it returns zero
    x) # "Summon the current state of x" - x is still the expression that sets y to 1 and then x to 2
       # However, y has already been returned - so even though y is now set to 1, it's called after the previous y and does not affect the previous y.
}
x = NULL
y = NULL
f1()
```

## 6.5.4.4 Exercise {-}

:::

We need to access is using `hist.<method>`

```{r, eval=FALSE}

## 6.6 dot dot dot {-}

:::question
"(See also `rlang::list2()` to support splicing and to silently ignore trailing commas..." Can we come up with a simple use case for `list2` here? The docs use `list2(a = 1, a = 2, b = 3, b = 4, 5, 6)` but how is this different from `list`?

```{r}
identical(
  rlang::list2(a = 1, a = 2, b = 3, b = 4, 5, 6) ,
  list(a = 1, a = 2, b = 3, b = 4, 5, 6)
)
```
:::

`list2` is most helpful when we need to force environment variables with ata variables. We can see this by crting a function that takes a variable number of arguments:

```{r}
library(rlang)

numeric_list <- function(...) {
  dots <- list(...)
  num <- as.numeric(dots)
  set_names(num, names(dots))
}

numeric_list2 <- function(...) {
  dots <- list2(...)
  num <- as.numeric(dots)
  set_names(num, names(dots))
}

numeric_list(1, 2, 3)
numeric_list2(1, 2, 3)
```

The main difference with list(...) is that list2(...) enables the `!!!` syntax to splice lists:

```{r}
x <- list(2, 3)
numeric_list2(1, !!! x, 4)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
numeric_list(1, !!! x, 4)
```

```
Error in !x : invalid argument type
```

:::question
"`lapply()` uses `...` to pass `na.rm` on to `mean()`" Um, how?

```{r}
x <- list(c(1, 3, NA), c(4, NA, 6))
str(lapply(x, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```
:::

An lapply takes on two main arguments: what you want to loop over and the function to apply to each element. By including `...` `lapply` allows you to supply additional arguments which will be passed to the function inside the `lapply`. In this case, `na.rm = TRUE` is being applied to mean every time it's being called in the loop.

:::question
I tried running `browser(plot(1:10, col = "red"))` to peek under the hood but only got `Called from: top level` in the console. What am I missing?

```

## 6.7.4 Exit handlers {-}

:::question
"Always set `add = TRUE` when using `on.exit()` If you donâ€™t, each call to `on.exit()` will overwrite the previous exit handler." What does this mean?
:::

`add = TRUE` is important when you have more than one `on.exit` function!

```{r}
j08 <- function() {
  on.exit(message("a"))
  on.exit(message("b"), add=TRUE)
}

j08()
```


:::question
Can we go over this code? How does it not change your working directory after you run the function

```{r}
cleanup <- function(dir, code) {
  old_dir <- setwd(dir)
  on.exit(setwd(old_dir), add = TRUE)
  
  old_opt <- options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  on.exit(options(old_opt), add = TRUE)
}


cleanup("~")
getwd()
```
:::

The behavior of [`setwd`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/getwd) "changing the working directory" is actually a **side effect** of the function - it invisibly returns the previous working directory as the value of the function (potentially for the exact purpose demonstrated). We can use this within our `on.exit` function to change back to the prior working directory! 


:::question
If `on.exit` fails will it continue onto the next `on.exit` so long as `add == TRUE`
?``on.exit fails it'll caontinue onto the next one
:::

```{r, eval=FALSE}
f <- function() {
  on.exit(stop("Error"))
  on.exit(message("yay, still called."), add = TRUE)
}
f()
```

```
Error in f() : Error
yay, still called.
```

:::

__[Q]{.Q}__: How does the `chdir` parameter of `source()` compare to `in_dir()`? Why might you prefer one approach to the other?
   The `in_dir()` approach was given in the book as
       
```{r, eval = FALSE}
    in_dir <- function(dir, code) {
      old <- setwd(dir)
      on.exit(setwd(old))
      
      force(code)
    }
```
    
   __[A]{.started}__: `in_dir()` takes a path to a working directory as an argument. First the working directory is changed accordingly. `on.exit()` ensures that the modification to the working directory are reset to the initial value when the function exits.
    
   In `source()` the `chdir` argument specifies if the working directory should be changed during the evaluation of the `file` argument (which in this case has to be a path name).

1. Copy `x` into a temporary variable `*temp*`
2. `[<-(names(*tmp*), 2, "two")` modifies the second element of the names of `*temp*`,
