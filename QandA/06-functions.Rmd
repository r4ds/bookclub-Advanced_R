## 6.2.2 Primitives {-}

:::question
So if you are familiar with C can you just write a function in C *in* R? What does that process look like? I think this is a bigger question of digging into the relationship between C and R.
:::

We can use RCPP!

```{r}
Rcpp::cppFunction('#include<string>
  std::string IPA() {
  std::string val = "IPAs suck";	
  return val;
  }')
val <- IPA()
val
```

1. __[Q]{.Q}__: Given a name, like `"mean"`, `match.fun()` lets you find a function. Given a function, can you find its name? Why doesn't that make sense in R?

    __[A]{.started}__: A name can only point to a single object, but an object can be pointed to by 0, 1, or many names. What are names of the functions in the following block?

    ```{r}
  function(x) sd(x) / mean(x)
    
  f1 <- function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
  f2 <- f1
  f3 <- f1
    ```

## 6.4 Lexical scoping {-}

:::question
"The scoping rules use a parse-time, rather than a run-time structure"? What is "parse-time" and "run-time"? How do they differ?
:::

parse-time is when the function gets defined: when the formals and body get set. run-time is when it actually gets called. This function doesn't get past parse-time because of the syntax error

```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_state <- function(in_df, state_name){
  out_df % in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ]
  return(out_df)
}
```

```
get_state <- function(in_df, state_name){
  out_df % in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ]

Error: unexpected input in:

"get_state <- function(in_df, state_name){
  out_df % in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ]"
  return(out_df)

Error: object 'out_df' not found
}

Error: unexpected '}' in "}"
```

This function will get parsed successfully but could fail at run at run-time if the input data frame doesn't have a column named state:

```{r}
get_state <- function(in_df, state_name){
  out_df <- in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ]
  return(out_df)
}  

get_state(iris, 'setosa')
```

At R's build-time, if you want to run a function from a package that isn't loaded it will not throw an error but at run-time it will if the required package is not loaded:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
func_1 <- function(df, x) {
  select({{ df }}, {{ x }})
}

test_tbl <- tibble::tibble(x1 = runif(5),
             x2 = rnorm(5),
             x3 = rpois(5, lambda = 1))
```

Without `dplyr` this will fail
```{R}
func_1(test_tbl, x1)
```

```
Error in select({: could not find function "select"
```

This will work:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
func_1(test_tbl, x1)
```


## 6.4.3 A fresh start {-}

:::question
How would we change this code so that the second call of `g11()` is 2?

```{r}
g11 <- function() {
  if (!exists("a")) {
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  a
}

g11()
```
:::

```{r}
g11 <- function() {
  if (!exists("a")) {
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  a <<- a
  a
}

g11()
```


##  6.5 Lazy evaluation {-}

:::question
"This allows you to do things like include potentially expensive computations in function arguments that will only be evaluated if needed"

Does anyone have an example of this? We discussed a function that will only perform expensive tasks given the context of the function perhaps?
:::

Maybe a situation where we can give a function default arguments where `sample`is a stand in for longer expensive functions like different fancy modeling techniques? We can workshop this...

```{r}
mega_model <- function(values, x = sample(1:100, 10), y = sample(200:300, 10), z = sample(300:400, 10)
) {
  dplyr::case_when(
    is.numeric(values) ~ x,
    is.character(values) ~ y,
    TRUE ~ z
  )
}

mega_model(c("a", "b", "c"))
```



## 6.5.1 Promises {-}

:::question
Can we discuss the order that this happening in? Is it that `Calculating...` is printed, then `x*2` then `x*2` again? I am still reading this as: `h03(double(20), double(20))` which is an incorrect mental model because the message is only printed once...

```{r}
double <- function(x) { 
  message("Calculating...")
  x * 2
}

h03 <- function(x) {
  c(x, x)
}
```
:::

```{r}
double <- function(y) {
  message("Calculating...")
  cat("double before\n")
  print(pryr::promise_info(y))
  force(y)
  cat("double after\n")
  print(pryr::promise_info(y))
  y * 2
}
h03 <- function(x) {
  cat(paste0("h03 before\n"))
  print(pryr::promise_info(x))
  force(x)
  cat("h03 after\n")
  print(pryr::promise_info(x))
  c(x, x)
}
double(h03(20))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/promise.png")
```


:::question
```{r}
f <- function(x, y) x + 2
f(2, var_doesnt_exist)
```

`var_doesnt_exist` is a promise within `g`, we use the promises within `g` when we call `f` but `f` never uses its second argument so this runs without a problem. When would we want to leverage this behavior?
:::

## 6.5.2 Default arguments {-}

:::question
I don't quite understand why `x = ls()` is different from `ls()` here; aren't we still assigning `x = ls()` but without specifying x?
```{r}
h05 <- function(x = ls()) {
  a <- 1
  x
}

# this makes sense to me
h05()
# how is this different from above?
h05(ls())
```

## 6.5.4.3 Exercise {-}

:::question

I understand this problem is showing us an example of name masking (the function doesn't need to use the `y = 0` argument because it gets `y` from within the definition of x, but I'm fuzzy on what exactly the `;` does. What does the syntax `{y <- 1; 2}` mean? Could it be read as "Set `y <- 1` and `x <- 2`?

```{r}
y <- 10
f1 <- function(x = {y <- 1; 2}, y = 0) {
  c(x, y)
}
f1()
```
:::

The curly brackets are an expression, which can be read as 

```{r}
{
  y <- 1
  2
}
```

This is returning `2` and setting `1` to `y`. The colon can be read as a new line in the expression. `x` is called inside the function and overwrites the argument value of `y`


## 6.5.4.4 Exercise {-}

:::question
I know this isn't exactly needed to answer the question, but how do we access a function that has methods? For instance - here I want to dig into the `hist` function using `hist`

```{r}
hist
```
does not give me the actual contents of the actual function....
:::

We need to access is using `hist.<method>`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hist.default
```

## 6.6 dot dot dot {-}

:::question
"(See also `rlang::list2()` to support splicing and to silently ignore trailing commas..." Can we come up with a simple use case for `list2` here? The docs use `list2(a = 1, a = 2, b = 3, b = 4, 5, 6)` but how is this different from `list`?

```{r}
identical(
  rlang::list2(a = 1, a = 2, b = 3, b = 4, 5, 6) ,
  list(a = 1, a = 2, b = 3, b = 4, 5, 6)
)

:::question
"`lapply()` uses `...` to pass `na.rm` on to `mean()`" Um, how?

```{r}
x <- list(c(1, 3, NA), c(4, NA, 6))
str(lapply(x, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```
:::

An lapply takes on two main arguments: what you want to loop over and the function to apply to each element. By including `...` `lapply` allows you to supply additional arguments which will be passed to the function inside the `lapply`. In this case, `na.rm = TRUE` is being applied to mean every time it's being called in the loop.

## 6.6.1.2 Exercise {-}

:::question
I tried running `browser(plot(1:10, col = "red"))` to peek under the hood but only got `Called from: top level` in the console. What am I missing?
:::

We can use `debugonce`!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
debugonce(plot())
```

## 6.7.4 Exit handlers {-}

:::question
"Always set `add = TRUE` when using `on.exit()` If you donâ€™t, each call to `on.exit()` will overwrite the previous exit handler." What does this mean?
:::

`add = TRUE` is important when you have more than one `on.exit` function!

```{r}
j08 <- function() {
  on.exit(message("a"))
  on.exit(message("b"), add=TRUE)
}

j08()
```


:::question
Can we go over this code? How does it not change your working directory after you run the function

```{r}
cleanup <- function(dir, code) {
  old_dir <- setwd(dir)
  on.exit(setwd(old_dir), add = TRUE)
  
  old_opt <- options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  on.exit(options(old_opt), add = TRUE)
}


cleanup("~")
getwd()
```
:::

The behavior of [`setwd`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/getwd) "changing the working directory" is actually a **side effect** of the function - it invisibly returns the previous working directory as the value of the function (potentially for the exact purpose demonstrated).


:::question
If `on.exit` fails will it continue onto the next `on.exit` so long as `add == TRUE`
?``on.exit fails it'll caontinue onto the next one
:::

```{r, eval=FALSE}
f <- function() {
  on.exit(stop("Error"))
  on.exit(message("yay, still called."), add = TRUE)
}
f()
```

```
Error in f() : Error
yay, still called.
```

[This question is flagged as "started" let's try to complete it!](https://github.com/Tazinho/Advanced-R-Solutions/blob/5043d9b06c7469a010c568ecb85e12bedca75207/2-06-Functions.Rmd#L350) Hadley comments in the repo: "I think I'm more interested in supplying a path vs. a logical value here".
:::

__[Q]{.Q}__: How does the `chdir` parameter of `source()` compare to `in_dir()`? Why might you prefer one approach to the other?
   The `in_dir()` approach was given in the book as
       
```{r, eval = FALSE}
    in_dir <- function(dir, code) {
      old <- setwd(dir)
      on.exit(setwd(old))
      
      force(code)
    }
```
    
   __[A]{.started}__: `in_dir()` takes a path to a working directory as an argument. First the working directory is changed accordingly. `on.exit()` ensures that the modification to the working directory are reset to the initial value when the function exits.
    
   In `source()` the `chdir` argument specifies if the working directory should be changed during the evaluation of the `file` argument (which in this case has to be a path name).

:::question
Can we go over the source code of `capture.output` and `capture.output2`? 

```{r}
body(capture.output)
```

```{r}
capture.output2 <- function(code) {
  temp <- tempfile()
  on.exit(file.remove(temp), add = TRUE)

  sink(temp)
  on.exit(sink(), add = TRUE)

  force(code)
  readLines(temp)
}
```

```{r}
identical(
  capture.output(cat("a", "b", "c", sep = "\n")),
  capture.output2(cat("a", "b", "c", sep = "\n"))
)
```

The second function is more concise but what is it missing from the first? I'd like to go over the first one line by line.
:::

`list2` is most helpful when we need to force environment variables with ata variables. We can see this by crting a function that takes a variable number of arguments:

```{r}
library(rlang)

numeric_list <- function(...) {
  dots <- list(...)
  num <- as.numeric(dots)
  set_names(num, names(dots))
}

numeric_list2 <- function(...) {
  dots <- list2(...)
  num <- as.numeric(dots)
  set_names(num, names(dots))
}

numeric_list(1, 2, 3)
numeric_list2(1, 2, 3)
```

The main difference with list(...) is that list2(...) enables the `!!!` syntax to splice lists:

```{r}
x <- list(2, 3)
numeric_list2(1, !!! x, 4)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
numeric_list(1, !!! x, 4)
```
```
Error in !x : invalid argument type
```

## 6.8.4 Replacement functions {-}

:::question
Can we put into words the translation for 

```{r}
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
names(x)
names(x)[2] <- "two"
names(x)
```

Being equal to

```{r, eval=FALSE}
`*tmp*` <- x
x <- `names<-`(`*tmp*`, `[<-`(names(`*tmp*`), 2, "two"))
rm(`*tmp*`)
```
:::

We can dig into the [source code](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/2cdea4811caa2417e2cf32a0c7ad3be70325eec1/src/main/eval.c#L2787), but the jist is that in order to implement these complex assignments:

1. Copy `x` into a temporary variable `*temp*`
2. `[<-(names(*tmp*), 2, "two")` modifies the second element of the names of `*temp*`, 
3. `names<-`(`*tmp*` assigns step 2 to `*temp*` names
4. Clean up by removing the temp variable

      x[position] <- value
