# Chapter 2 

## 2.3 Copy-on-modify 

:::question
copy-on-modify vs copy-in-place: is one more preferable in certain situations?
:::

modify in place only happens when objects with a single binding get a special performance optimization and to environments.

## 2.3.2 Function calls

:::question
Can we go over and break down figure in 2.3.2
:::

When you create this function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
crazyfunction <- function(eh) {eh}
```

`eh` doesn't exist in memory at this point.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1,2,3)
```

x exists in memory.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
z <- crazyfunction(x) 
```

`z` now points at `x`, and `eh` still doesn't exist (except metaphorically in Canada). `eh` was created and exists WHILE `crazyfunction()` was being run, but doesn't get saved to the global environment, so after the function is run you can't see its memory reference. 

The round brackets `(eh)` list the arguments, the curly brackets `{eh}` define the operation that it's doing - and you're assigning it to `crazyfunction`. 

**R functions automatically return the result of the last expression** so when you call that object (the argument `eh`) it returns the value of that argument. This is called **implicit returns**

## 2.3.3 Lists

:::question
When would you prefer a deep copy of a list to a shallow copy? Is this something to consider when writing functions or package development or is this more something that's optimized behind the scenes?
:::

Automagical!

## 2.3.5 Character vectors


:::question
Is there a way to clear the "global string pool"?
:::

:::TODO
XXX
:::

## 2.4.1 Object size

:::question
I understand that `ALTREP` makes the size of `obj_size(1:3) == obj_size(1:100)` but do I need to have a better grasp than that? [Should we go over this](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/09/altrep-preview.html)
:::

It's kind of cool to know but... Probably not.

## 2.5.1 Modify-in-place

:::question
"When it comes to bindings, R can currently only count 0, 1, or many. That means that if an object has two bindings, and one goes away, the reference count does not go back to 1: one less than many is still many. In turn, this means that R will make copies when it sometimes doesn’t need to."

Can we come up with an example of this? It seems really theoretical right now.
:::

:::TODO
XXX
:::

:::question

Can we break down this code a bit more? I'd like to really understand when and how it's copying three times.

```{r}
# dataframe of 5 columns of numbers
x <- data.frame(matrix(runif(5 * 1e4), ncol = 5))
# median number for each column
medians <- vapply(x, median, numeric(1))

# subtract the median of each column from each value in the column
for (i in seq_along(medians)) {
  x[[i]] <- x[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}
```
:::


```{r, eval=FALSE}
cat(tracemem(x), "\n")
```

```
<0x7fdc99a6f9a8> 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (i in 1:5) {
  x[[i]] <- x[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}
```

```
tracemem[0x7fdc99a6f9a8 -> 0x7fdc9de83e38]: 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de83e38 -> 0x7fdc9de83ea8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de83ea8 -> 0x7fdc9de83f18]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de83f18 -> 0x7fdc9de83f88]: 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de83f88 -> 0x7fdc9de83ff8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de83ff8 -> 0x7fdc9de84068]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84068 -> 0x7fdc9de840d8]: 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de840d8 -> 0x7fdc9de84148]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84148 -> 0x7fdc9de841b8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de841b8 -> 0x7fdc9de84228]: 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84228 -> 0x7fdc9de84298]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84298 -> 0x7fdc9de84308]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84308 -> 0x7fdc9de84378]: 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84378 -> 0x7fdc9de843e8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de843e8 -> 0x7fdc9de84458]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
```

When we run `tracemem` on the for loop above we see each column is copied twice followed by the `[[<-.data.frame [[<- `, the stack trace showing exactly where the duplication occurred.

So what is ``[[<-.data.frame``? It's a function! By looking at `?``[[<-.data.frame`` we see this is used to "extract or replace subsets of data frames."

When we write `x[[i]] <- value`, it's really shorthand for calling the function `[[<-.data.frame` with inputs `x`, `i`, and `value`. 

Now let's step into the call of this base function by running `debug(``[[<-.data.frame``)`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
debug(`[[<-.data.frame`)
```

and once inside, use `tracemem()` to find where the new values are assigned to the column:

```{r eval=FALSE}
function (x, i, j, value) 
{
  if (!all(names(sys.call()) %in% c("", "value"))) 
    warning("named arguments are discouraged")
  cl <- oldClass(x)
  # this is where another copy of x is made!
  class(x) <- NULL
```

```
 # tracemem[0x7fdc9d852a18 -> 0x7fdc9c99cc08]: 
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nrows <- .row_names_info(x, 2L)
  if (is.atomic(value) && !is.null(names(value))) 
    names(value) <- NULL
  if (nargs() < 4L) {
    nc <- length(x)
    if (!is.null(value)) {
      N <- NROW(value)
      if (N > nrows) 
        stop(sprintf(ngettext(N, "replacement has %d row, data has %d",

    class(x) <- cl
    return(x)

  nvars <- length(x)
  if (n <- is.character(i)) {
    ii <- match(i, rows)
    n <- sum(new.rows <- is.na(ii))
    if (n > 0L) {
      ii[new.rows] <- seq.int(from = nrows + 1L, length.out = n)
      new.rows <- i[new.rows]
    }
    i <- ii
  }
  if (all(i >= 0L) && (nn <- max(i)) > nrows) {
    if (n == 0L) {
      nrr <- (nrows + 1L):nn
      if (inherits(value, "data.frame") && (dim(value)[1L]) >=

    rows <- attr(x, "row.names")
    nrows <- length(rows)
  }
  iseq <- seq_len(nrows)[i]
  if (anyNA(iseq)) 
    stop("non-existent rows not allowed")
  if (is.character(j)) {
    if ("" %in% j) 
      stop("column name \"\" cannot match any column")
    jseq <- match(j, names(x))
    if (anyNA(jseq)) 
      stop(gettextf("replacing element in non-existent column: %s",

  }
  else if (is.logical(j) || min(j) < 0L) 
    jseq <- seq_along(x)[j]
  else {
    jseq <- j
    if (max(jseq) > nvars) 
      stop(gettextf("replacing element in non-existent column: %s", 
        jseq[jseq > nvars]), domain = NA)
  }
  if (length(iseq) > 1L || length(jseq) > 1L) 
    stop("only a single element should be replaced")
  x[[jseq]][[iseq]] <- value
  # here is where x is copied again!
  class(x) <- cl
```

```
# tracemem[0x7fdc992ae9d8 -> 0x7fdc9be55258]:

Thus seeing exactly where the three copies are happening!

# Chapter 3

## 3.2.1 Scalars

:::question
Can you have `NA` in vector
:::

Hell yeah!

## 3.2.3 Missing values

:::question
`NA` is a 'sentinel' value for explicit missingness - what does 'sentinel' mean?
:::

A sentinel value (also referred to as a flag value, trip value, rogue value, signal value, or dummy data) is a special value in the context of an algorithm which uses its presence as a condition of termination. Also worth noting two NAs are not equal to each other! For instance, in C++ there’s a special character to identify the end of a string I think another example of a sentinel value might be in surveys where you sometimes see missing data or N/A coded as 999, or 9999 (or maybe just 9)


Another example of a sentinel value might be in surveys where you sometimes see missing data or `N/A` coded as `999`, or `9999` (or maybe just `9`). The possible values in a column of data might be:

```{r eval=FALSE}
factor(c(1,1,1,1,2,3,3,4,4,9), levels = c(1,2,3,4,9))
```

Sentinels are typically employed in situations where it's easier/preferable to have a collection of values of the same type - represented internally using the same conventions and requiring the same amount of memory - but you also need a way to indicate a special circumstance. So like in the case of survey data you may, for example, see a variable indicating that an individual is `999` years old but the correct way to interpret that is that the data was not collected.

## 3.2.4 Testing and coercion

:::question
Why does the book warn us against using `is.vector()`, `is.atomic()` and `is.numeric()`? [read docs]
:::

- `is.atomic` will also return true if `NULL`
- `is.numeric` tests if integer or double **NOT** factor, Date, POSIXt, difftime
- `is.vector` will return false if it has attributes other than names

## 3.3.1 Setting Attributes 

:::question
Working in the medical field I have to import SAS files a lot where the column names have to adhere to specific abbreviations so they're given a label attribute for their full name. What are some other common uses for attributes?
:::

Hypothesis test attributes!


## 3.3.2 setNames

:::question
We can use `setNames` to apply different values to each element in a vector. How do we do this for our own custom attribute? The code below does NOT work!

```{r}
my_vector <- c(
  structure(1, x = "firstatt_1"),
  structure(2, x = "firstatt_2"), 
  structure(3, x = "firstatt_3")
)

my_vector <- setNames(my_vector, c("name_1", "name_2", "name_3"))

# mental model: shouldn't this should return $names and $x?
attributes(my_vector)
```
:::

As soon as you instantiate a vector the attributes are lost. BUT we can store it as a list *within* the vector to keep them! We can create a custom attribute function and use that with `map` to add a list inside our dataframe:

```{r}
custom_attr <- function(x, my_attr) {
  attr(x, "x") <- my_attr
  return(x)
}

as_tb <- 
  tibble(
  one = c(1,2,3),
  x = c("att_1", "att_2", "att_3"),
  with_arr = map2(one, x, ~custom_attr(.x, .y))
)

as_tb$with_arr
```

## 3.3.3 Dimensions

:::question
Because `NROW` and `NCOL` don't return `NULL` on a one dimensional vector they just seem to me as a more flexible option. When do you *have* to use `ncol` and `nrow`?
:::

It *may* be better practice to always use `NROW` and `NCOL`!

:::question
As long as the number of rows matches the data frame, it’s also possible to have a matrix or array as a column of a data frame. (This requires a slight extension to our definition of a data frame: it’s not the `length()` of each column that must be equal, but the `NROW()`.)

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = c(1,2,3,4,5),
                 y = c(letters[1:5]))

length(df$y) == NROW(df$y)
```

What's an example of where `length() != NROW()`
:::

The case of a matrix! 

```{r}
my_matrix <- 1:6
dim(my_matrix) <- c(3,2)
my_matrix
length(my_matrix) == NROW(my_matrix) # 6 != 3
length(my_matrix) == NCOL(my_matrix) # 6 != 2
```

The length of the matrix is `6`, and if we manipulate the dimensions of the matrix we see that the NROW is `3` and and NCOL is `2`.

## 3.4 S3 atomic vectors

:::question
How is data type `typeof()` different from `class()`?
:::

Classes are built on top of base types - they're like special, more specific kinds of types. In fact, if a class isn't specified then `class()` will default to either the `implicit class` or `typeof`.

So `Date`, `POSIXct`, and `difftime` are specific kinds of doubles, falling under its umbrella.
```{r}
lubridate::is.Date(Sys.Date())
is.double(Sys.Date())

lubridate::is.POSIXct(Sys.time())
is.double(Sys.time())

lubridate::is.difftime(as.difftime(c("0:3:20", "11:23:15")))
is.double(as.difftime(c("0:3:20", "11:23:15")))
```

But then why does `my_factor` fail to be recognized under its more general `integer` umbrella?

```{r}
my_factor <- factor(c("a", "b", "c"))
is.factor(my_factor)
is.integer(my_factor)
```


## 3.4.2 Dates

:::question
Why are dates calculated from January 1st, 1970?
:::

Unix counts time in seconds since its official "birthday," -- called "epoch" in computing terms -- which is Jan. 1, 1970. [This article](https://www.wired.com/2001/09/unix-tick-tocks-to-a-billion/) explains that the early Unix engineers picked that date arbitrarily, because they needed to set a uniform date for the start of time, and New Year's Day, 1970, seemed most convenient.

## 3.5.1 Lists

:::question

The length of the matrix is `6`, and if we manipulate the dimensions of the matrix we see that the NROW is `3` and and NCOL is `2`.

## 3.4 S3 atomic vectors

:::question
How is data type `typeof()` different from `class()`?
:::

Classes are built on top of base types - they're like special, more specific kinds of types. In fact, if a class isn't specified then `class()` will default to either the `implicit class` or `typeof`.

So `Date`, `POSIXct`, and `difftime` are specific kinds of doubles, falling under its umbrella.
```{r}
lubridate::is.Date(Sys.Date())
is.double(Sys.Date())

lubridate::is.POSIXct(Sys.time())
is.double(Sys.time())

lubridate::is.difftime(as.difftime(c("0:3:20", "11:23:15")))
is.double(as.difftime(c("0:3:20", "11:23:15")))
```

But then why does `my_factor` fail to be recognized under its more general `integer` umbrella?

```{r}
my_factor <- factor(c("a", "b", "c"))
is.factor(my_factor)
is.integer(my_factor)
```


## 3.4.2 Dates

:::question
Why are dates calculated from January 1st, 1970?
:::

Unix counts time in seconds since its official "birthday," -- called "epoch" in computing terms -- which is Jan. 1, 1970. [This article](https://www.wired.com/2001/09/unix-tick-tocks-to-a-billion/) explains that the early Unix engineers picked that date arbitrarily, because they needed to set a uniform date for the start of time, and New Year's Day, 1970, seemed most convenient.

## 3.5.1 Lists

:::question
When should you be using `list()` instead of `c()`
:::

It's really contingent on the use case. In the case of adding custom classes it's worth noting that those are lost once you `c()` those objects together!

## 3.6.8 Dataframes and tibbles

:::question
What does 'lazy' mean in terms of `as_tibble`?
:::
  
Technically `lazy evaluation` means that expressions are not evaluated when they are bound to variables, but their evaluation is deferred until their results are needed by other computations. In this context though we think Hadley just meant that it's treated as a character if it "looks and smells like a character". 


:::question
The solution manual gives the answer and notes:

```{r}
df_coltypes <- data.frame(
  a = c("a", "b"),
  b = c(TRUE, FALSE),
  c = c(1L, 0L),
  d = c(1.5, 2),
  e = c("one" = 1, "two" = 2),
  g = factor(c("f1", "f2")),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

as.matrix(df_coltypes)
```

"Note that `format()` is applied to the characters, which gives surprising results: `TRUE` is transformed to `" TRUE"` (starting with a space!)."

...But where is the `format()` call happening? I don't see a space!
:::

```{r, eval=FALSE}
debug(as.matrix(df_coltypes))
```

If we step into the as.matrix function we see that the values are all first converted to character, the least specific (TODO - specific is not the right word) type.

:::TODO
We can see where `format()` is called but why does the author mention a space before "TRUE" when it is converted to a character?

```{r}
as.character(TRUE)
```
:::

## Conclusion 

:::question
How does vectorization make your code faster
:::

All vectors are of types in R, and if you know what your data type is you don't have to coerce to different types along the way. It's related too to copy-on-modify, because... TODO you don't have to copy over every row of your data as you would within a for-loop.

"There are three subsetting operators `[`. `[[`, `$`. What is the destinction between an operator and a function? When you look up the help page it brings up the same page for all three extraction methods. What are their destinctions and do their definitions change based on what you're subsetting? Can we make a table? 
:::

:::TODO
|  | `[` | `[[` | `$` |
|---|---|---|---|
| atomic | select any number of elements | extract single element | |
| list | returns a smaller list | single element from a list | |
| matrices | simplifies to lowest dimensonality | |
| data frame | subsetting a list of columns | subsets like matrices | subset column |

## 4.3.5 Exercise

:::question
The question asks to describe the `upper.tri` function - let's dig into it!
:::

```{r}
x <- outer(1:5, 1:5, FUN = "*")
upper.tri(x)
```

We see that it returns the upper triangle of the matrix. But I wanted to walk through how this function actually works and what is meant in the solution manual by leveraging `.row(dim(x)) <= .col(dim(x))`.

:::TODO
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# ?upper.tri
function (x, diag = FALSE) 
{
    d <- dim(x)
    # what is this part of the function doing
    if (length(d) != 2L) 
        d <- dim(as.matrix(x))
    if (diag) 
      # this is our subsetting logical!
        .row(d) <= .col(d)
    else .row(d) < .col(d)
}
```
:::

The function `.row()` and `.col()` return a matrix of integers indicating their row number

```{r}
.row(dim(x))
```

```{r}
.col(dim(x))
```

```{r}
.row(dim(x)) <= .col(dim(x))
```

### ATOMIC

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1,2,3, NULL)
# zero length
# out of bounds
# missing
```

### LIST 
```{r, eval=FALSE}

num_list <- list(1,2,3)
chr_list <- list("1","2","3")

# zero length
# out of bounds
# out of bounds character
# missing 
```

### NULL

```{r}
# zero length
# out of bounds

## 4.5.8 Logical subsetting

:::question
"Remember to use the vector boolean operators `&` and `|`, not the short-circuiting scalar operators `&&` and `||`, which are more useful inside if statements." 

Can we go over the difference between `&` and `&&` (and `|` vs `||`) I use brute force to figure out which ones I need...
:::

`&&` and `||` only ever return a single (scalar, length-1 vector) `TRUE` or `FALSE` value, whereas `|` and `&` return a vector after doing element-by-element comparisons.

The only place in R you routinely use a scalar `TRUE`/`FALSE` value is in the conditional of an `if` statement, so you'll often see `&&` or `||` used in idioms like: `if (length(x) > 0 && any(is.na(x))) { do.something() }`

In most other instances you'll be working with vectors and use `&` and `|` instead.

Using `&&` or `||` results in some unexpected behavior - which could be a big performance gain in some cases:

- `||` will not evaluate the second argument when the first is `TRUE`
- `&&` will not evaluate the second argument when the first is `FALSE`

```{r}
true_one <- function() { print("true_one evaluated."); TRUE}
true_two <- function() { print("true_two evaluated."); TRUE}
# arguments are evaluated lazily.  Unexpected behavior can result.
c(T, true_one()) && c(T, true_two())
c(T, true_one()) && c(F, true_two())
c(F, true_one()) && c(T, true_two()) 
c(F, true_one()) && c(F, true_two()) 
c(T, true_one()) || c(T, true_two())
c(T, true_one()) || c(F, true_two())
c(F, true_one()) || c(T, true_two()) 
c(F, true_one()) || c(F, true_two()) 
```

## 4.5.8 Boolean algebra

:::question
What is a use case for reversing which with the `unwhich()` function
:::

:::TODO

:::

:::question
"`x[-which(y)]` is not equivalent to `x[!y]`: if `y` is all FALSE, `which(y)` will be `integer(0)` and `-integer(0)` is still `integer(0)`, so you’ll get no values, instead of all values."

Can we come up with an example for this plugging in values for `x` and `y`
