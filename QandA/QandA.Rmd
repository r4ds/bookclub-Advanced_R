## 2.3 Copy-on-modify 

:::question
copy-on-modify vs copy-in-place: is one more preferable in certain situations?
:::

modify in place only happens when objects with a single binding get a special performance optimization and to environments.

## 2.3.2 Function calls

:::question
Can we go over and break down figure in 2.3.2
:::

When you create this function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
crazyfunction <- function(eh) {eh}
```

`eh` doesn't exist in memory at this point.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1,2,3)
```

x exists in memory.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
z <- crazyfunction(x) 
```

`z` now points at `x`, and `eh` still doesn't exist (except metaphorically in Canada). `eh` was created and exists WHILE `crazyfunction()` was being run, but doesn't get saved to the global environment, so after the function is run you can't see its memory reference. 

The round brackets `(eh)` list the arguments, the curly brackets `{eh}` define the operation that it's doing - and you're assigning it to `crazyfunction`. 

**R functions automatically return the result of the last expression** so when you call that object (the argument `eh`) it returns the value of that argument. This is called **implicit returns**

## 2.3.3 Lists

:::question
When would you prefer a deep copy of a list to a shallow copy? Is this something to consider when writing functions or package development or is this more something that's optimized behind the scenes?
:::

Automagical!

## 2.3.5 Character vectors


:::question
Is there a way to clear the "global string pool"?
:::

## 2.4.1 Object size


:::question
I understand that `ALTREP` makes the size of `obj_size(1:3) == obj_size(1:100)` but do I need to have a better grasp than that? [Should we go over this](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/09/altrep-preview.html)
:::

It's kind of cool to know but... Probably not.

## 2.5.1 Modify-in-place

:::question
"When it comes to bindings, R can currently only count 0, 1, or many. That means that if an object has two bindings, and one goes away, the reference count does not go back to 1: one less than many is still many. In turn, this means that R will make copies when it sometimes doesn’t need to."

Can we come up with an example of this? It seems really theoretical right now.
:::

XXX

:::question

Can we break down this code a bit more? I'd like to really understand when and how it's copying three times.

```{r}
# dataframe of 5 columns of numbers
x <- data.frame(matrix(runif(5 * 1e4), ncol = 5))
# median number for each column
medians <- vapply(x, median, numeric(1))

# subtract the median of each column from each value in the column
for (i in seq_along(medians)) {
  x[[i]] <- x[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}
```
:::


```{r, eval=FALSE}
cat(tracemem(x), "\n")
```

```
<0x7fdc99a6f9a8> 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (i in 1:5) {
  x[[i]] <- x[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}
```

```
tracemem[0x7fdc99a6f9a8 -> 0x7fdc9de83e38]: 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de83e38 -> 0x7fdc9de83ea8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de83ea8 -> 0x7fdc9de83f18]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de83f18 -> 0x7fdc9de83f88]: 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de83f88 -> 0x7fdc9de83ff8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de83ff8 -> 0x7fdc9de84068]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84068 -> 0x7fdc9de840d8]: 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de840d8 -> 0x7fdc9de84148]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84148 -> 0x7fdc9de841b8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de841b8 -> 0x7fdc9de84228]: 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84228 -> 0x7fdc9de84298]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84298 -> 0x7fdc9de84308]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84308 -> 0x7fdc9de84378]: 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de84378 -> 0x7fdc9de843e8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fdc9de843e8 -> 0x7fdc9de84458]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
```

When we run `tracemem` on the for loop above we see each column is copied twice followed by the `[[<-.data.frame [[<- `, the stack trace showing exactly where the duplication occurred.

So what is ``[[<-.data.frame``? It's a function! By looking at `?``[[<-.data.frame`` we see this is used to "extract or replace subsets of data frames."

When we write `x[[i]] <- value`, it's really shorthand for calling the function `[[<-.data.frame` with inputs `x`, `i`, and `value`. 

Now let's step into the call of this base function by running `debug(``[[<-.data.frame``)`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
debug(`[[<-.data.frame`)
```

and once inside, use `tracemem()` to find where the new values are assigned to the column:

```{r eval=FALSE}
function (x, i, j, value) 
{
  if (!all(names(sys.call()) %in% c("", "value"))) 
    warning("named arguments are discouraged")
  cl <- oldClass(x)
  # this is where another copy of x is made!
  class(x) <- NULL
```

```
 # tracemem[0x7fdc9d852a18 -> 0x7fdc9c99cc08]: 
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nrows <- .row_names_info(x, 2L)
  if (is.atomic(value) && !is.null(names(value))) 
    names(value) <- NULL
  if (nargs() < 4L) {
    nc <- length(x)
    if (!is.null(value)) {
      N <- NROW(value)
      if (N > nrows) 
        stop(sprintf(ngettext(N, "replacement has %d row, data has %d",

        names(x)[nc] <- paste0("V", nc)
      names(x) <- make.unique(names(x))
    }
    class(x) <- cl
    return(x)

  if (missing(i) || missing(j)) 
    stop("only valid calls are x[[j]] <- value or x[[i,j]] <- value")
  rows <- attr(x, "row.names")
  nvars <- length(x)

    ii <- match(i, rows)
    n <- sum(new.rows <- is.na(ii))
    if (n > 0L) {
      ii[new.rows] <- seq.int(from = nrows + 1L, length.out = n)
      new.rows <- i[new.rows]
    }
    i <- ii
  }
  if (all(i >= 0L) && (nn <- max(i)) > nrows) {
    if (n == 0L) {
      nrr <- (nrows + 1L):nn
      if (inherits(value, "data.frame") && (dim(value)[1L]) >= 
        length(nrr)) {
        new.rows <- attr(value, "row.names")[seq_len(nrr)]
        repl <- duplicated(new.rows) | match(new.rows, 
          rows, 0L)
        if (any(repl)) 
          new.rows[repl] <- nrr[repl]
      }

    }
    x <- xpdrows.data.frame(x, rows, new.rows)

    nrows <- length(rows)
  }
  iseq <- seq_len(nrows)[i]
  if (anyNA(iseq)) 
    stop("non-existent rows not allowed")
  if (is.character(j)) {
    if ("" %in% j) 
      stop("column name \"\" cannot match any column")
    jseq <- match(j, names(x))
    if (anyNA(jseq)) 
      stop(gettextf("replacing element in non-existent column: %s", 
        j[is.na(jseq)]), domain = NA)
  }
  else if (is.logical(j) || min(j) < 0L) 
    jseq <- seq_along(x)[j]
  else {
    jseq <- j
    if (max(jseq) > nvars) 
      stop(gettextf("replacing element in non-existent column: %s", 
        jseq[jseq > nvars]), domain = NA)
  }
  if (length(iseq) > 1L || length(jseq) > 1L) 
    stop("only a single element should be replaced")
  x[[jseq]][[iseq]] <- value
  # here is where x is copied again!
  class(x) <- cl
```

```
# tracemem[0x7fdc992ae9d8 -> 0x7fdc9be55258]: 
```
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
  x
}
```

Thus seeing exactly where the three copies are happening!

# Chapter 3

:::question
How is data type `typeof()` different from `class()`?
:::

Classes are built on top of base types - they're like special, more specific kinds of types. In fact, if a class isn't specified then `class()` will default to either the `implicit class` or `typeof`.

So `Date`, `POSIXct`, and `difftime` are specific kinds of doubles, falling under its umbrella.
```{r}
lubridate::is.Date(Sys.Date())
is.double(Sys.Date())

lubridate::is.POSIXct(Sys.time())
is.double(Sys.time())

lubridate::is.difftime(as.difftime(c("0:3:20", "11:23:15")))
is.double(as.difftime(c("0:3:20", "11:23:15")))
```

But then why does `my_factor` fail to be recognized under its more general `integer` umbrella?

```{r}
my_factor <- factor(c("a", "b", "c"))
is.factor(my_factor)
is.integer(my_factor)
```


:::question
Why does the book warn us against using `is.vector()`, `is.atomic()` and `is.numeric()`? [read docs]
:::

- `is.atomic` will also return true if `NULL`
- `is.numeric` tests if integer or double **NOT** factor, Date, POSIXt, difftime
- `is.vector` will return false if it has attributes other than names

:::question
Working in the medical field I have to import SAS files a lot where the column names have to adhere to specific abbreviations so they're given a label attribute for their full name. What are some other common uses for attributes?
:::

Hypothesis test attributes!

:::question
We can use `setNames` to apply different values to each element in a vector. How do we do this for our own custom attribute? The code below does NOT work!

```{r}
my_vector <- c(
  structure(1, x = "firstatt_1", y = "secondatt_1"), 
  structure(2, x = "firstatt_2", y = "secondatt_2"), 
  structure(3, x = "firstatt_3", y = "secondatt_3")
)

my_vector <- setNames(my_vector, c("name_1", "name_2", "name_3"))

# mental model: shouldn't this should return $names, $x and $y ?
attributes(my_vector)
```
:::

As soon as you instantiate my vector the attributes are lost, store it as a list to keep them:

```{r}
# TODO
```


:::question
Because `NROW` and `NCOL` don't return `NULL` on a one dimensional vector they just seem to me as a more flexible option. When do you *have* to use `ncol` and `nrow`?
:::

It may be better practice to always use `NROW` and `NCOL`!

:::question
Putting it all together: the diagram.
:::

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/vectors.png")
```


:::question
As long as the number of rows matches the data frame, it’s also possible to have a matrix or array as a column of a data frame. (This requires a slight extension to our definition of a data frame: it’s not the `length()` of each column that must be equal, but the `NROW()`.)

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = c(1,2,3,4,5),
                 y = c(letters[1:5]))

length(df$y) == NROW(df$y)
```

What's an example of where `length() != NROW()`
:::

```{r}
# doesn't seem to matter for a data frame
my_df <- data.frame(x = c(1,2,3), y = c(4, 5, 6))
nrow(my_df) == NROW(my_df)
ncol(my_df) ==NCOL(my_df)

# and a matrix....
my_matrix <- 1:6
dim(my_matrix) <- c(3,2)
nrow(my_matrix) == NROW(my_matrix)
ncol(my_matrix) == NCOL(my_matrix)
```

The length of the dataframe is the same, but the length of the matrix is the same as every element of that matrix.

:::question
The solution manual gives the answer and notes: 

```{r}
df_coltypes <- data.frame(
  a = c("a", "b"),
  b = c(TRUE, FALSE),
  c = c(1L, 0L),
  d = c(1.5, 2),
  e = c("one" = 1, "two" = 2),
  g = factor(c("f1", "f2")),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

as.matrix(df_coltypes)
```

"Note that `format()` is applied to the characters, which gives surprising results: `TRUE` is transformed to `" TRUE"` (starting with a space!)."

...But where is the `format()` call happening? I don't see a space!

XXX

:::question
`NA` is a 'sentinel' value for explicit missingness - what does 'sentinel' mean?
:::

A sentinel value (also referred to as a flag value, trip value, rogue value, signal value, or dummy data) is a special value in the context of an algorithm which uses its presence as a condition of termination. Also worth noting two NAs are not equal to each other! For instance, in C++ there’s a special character to identify the end of a string

:::question
Why are dates calculated from January 1st, 1970?
:::

XXX

:::question
What does 'lazy' mean in terms of `as_tibble`?
:::

Technically `lazy evaluation` means that expressions are not evaluated when they are bound to variables, but their evaluation is deferred until their results are needed by other computations. In this context though we think Hadley just meant that it's treated as a character if it "looks and smells like a character". 

:::question
When should u be using `list()` instead of `c()`
:::

It's really contingent on the use case...

:::question
Can you have `NA` in vector
:::

Hell yeah!

:::question
How does vectorization make your code faster
:::

If you know what your data type is you don't have to coerce to different types along the way. It's related too to copy-on-modify, because you don't have to copy over every row of your data as you would within a for-loop.
