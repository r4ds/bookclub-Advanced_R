Guided by this blogpost, we can use the .Internal function to inspect metadata associated with our objects: x &lt;- list(1:5) .Internal(inspect(x)) # &gt; @0x000001b6a4af9fc8 19 VECSXP g0c1 [NAM(7)] (len=1, tl=0) # &gt; @0x000001b6a3321d90 13 INTSXP g0c0 [NAM(7)] 1 : 5 (compact) @0x000001b6a4af9fc8 – address (memory location) 19 VECSXP – type (full list here) g0 – garbage collector info token c1 – size of object (small vector) NAM(7) – named value of the object (if greater than one copy on modify) len=1 – length of object tl – true length of object small snippet of the data { x &lt;- list(1:5) .Internal(inspect(x)) } # &lt; @0x000001b6a4b4a3a0 19 VECSXP g0c1 [NAM(1)] (len=1, tl=0) # &lt; @0x000001b6a3a814d0 13 INTSXP g0c0 [NAM(7)] 1 : 5 (compact) It is of note here that without curly brackets we have to use copy-on-modify, but within curly brackes we can use copy-in-place because NAM(1) 2.3 Copy-on-modify copy-on-modify vs copy-in-place: is one more preferable in certain situations? modify in place only happens when objects with a single binding get a special performance optimization and to environments. 2.2.2 Exercises Question 3 digs into the syntactically valid names created when using read.csv(), but what is the difference between quotation and backticks? If we create an example csv example2223 &lt;- tibble( `if` = c(1,2,3), `_1234` = c(4,5,6), `column 1` = c(7,8,9) ) write.csv(example2223, &quot;example2223.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE) Import using adjusted column names to be syntactically valid: read.csv(file = &quot;example2223.csv&quot;,check.names = TRUE) ## if. X_1234 column.1 ## 1 1 4 7 ## 2 2 5 8 ## 3 3 6 9 Import using non-adjusted column names read.csv(file = &quot;example2223.csv&quot;, check.names = FALSE) ## if _1234 column 1 ## 1 1 4 7 ## 2 2 5 8 ## 3 3 6 9 Import using the tidyverse where names are not adjusted df_non_syntactic_name &lt;- read_csv(file = &quot;example2223.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## `if` = col_double(), ## `_1234` = col_double(), ## `column 1` = col_double() ## ) However I really don´t understand the difference between backticks and quotation marks. For example when I select a column in the case of non-syntactic in the tidyverse I can use quotation marks or backticks df_non_syntactic_name %&gt;% select(&quot;if&quot;) ## # A tibble: 3 x 1 ## `if` ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 df_non_syntactic_name %&gt;% select(`if`) But in base R, I can do this with quotation marks, but not backticks: df__non_syntactic_name[&quot;if&quot;] Error in `[.default`(df__non_syntactic_name, `if`) : invalid subscript type &#39;special&#39; According to ?Quotes backticks are used for “non-standard variable names” but why in base R they don´t work to select columns but in the tidyverse they work to select variables? The easiest way to think about this is that backticks refer to objects while quotation marks refer to strings. dplyr::select() accepts object references as well as string references, while base R subsetting is done with a string or integer position. 2.3.2 Function calls Can we go over and break down figure in 2.3.2 When you create this function: crazyfunction &lt;- function(eh) {eh} eh doesn’t exist in memory at this point. x &lt;- c(1,2,3) x exists in memory. z &lt;- crazyfunction(x) z now points at x, and eh still doesn’t exist (except metaphorically in Canada). eh was created and exists WHILE crazyfunction() was being run, but doesn’t get saved to the global environment, so after the function is run you can’t see its memory reference. The round brackets (eh) list the arguments, the curly brackets {eh} define the operation that it’s doing - and you’re assigning it to crazyfunction. R functions automatically return the result of the last expression so when you call that object (the argument eh) it returns the value of that argument. This is called implicit returns 2.3.3 Lists Checking the address for a list and its copy we see they share the same references: l1 &lt;- list(1,2,3) l2 &lt;- l1 identical(lobstr::ref(l1),lobstr::ref(l2)) ## [1] TRUE lobstr::obj_addr(l1[[1]]) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05970f340&quot; lobstr::obj_addr(l2[[1]]) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05970f340&quot; But why isn’t this the case for their subsets? Using obj_addr they have different addresses, but when we look at their references they are the same lobstr::obj_addr(l1[1]) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05a0433f0&quot; lobstr::ref(l1[1]) ## █ [1:0x7fa0573c98f8] &lt;list&gt; ## └─[2:0x7fa05970f340] &lt;dbl&gt; lobstr::obj_addr(l2[1]) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05a050ee0&quot; identical(lobstr::obj_addr(l1[1]), lobstr::obj_addr(l2[1])) ## [1] FALSE This is because using singular brackets wraps the value 1 in a new list that is created on the fly which will have a unique address. We can use double brackets to confirm our mental model that the sublists are also identical: identical(lobstr::obj_addr(l1[[1]]), lobstr::obj_addr(l2[[1]])) ## [1] TRUE What’s the difference between these 2 addresses &lt;0x55d53fa975b8&gt; and 0x55d53fa975b8? Nothing - it has to do with the printing method: x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) print(tracemem(x)) ## [1] &quot;&lt;0x7fa0573d8d98&gt;&quot; cat(tracemem(x)) ## &lt;0x7fa0573d8d98&gt; lobstr::obj_addr(x) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa0573d8d98&quot; When would you prefer a deep copy of a list to a shallow copy? Is this something to consider when writing functions or package development or is this more something that’s optimized behind the scenes? Automagical! 2.3.5 Character vectors Is there a way to clear the “global string pool”? According to this post it doesn’t look like you can directly, but clearing all references to a string that’s in the global string pool clears that string from the pool, eventually 2.3.6.2 Exercise When we look at tracemem when we modify x from an integer to numeric, x is assigned to three objects. The first is the integer, and the third numeric - so what’s the intermediate type? x &lt;- c(1L, 2L, 3L) obj_addr(x) tracemem(x) x[[3]] &lt;- 4 [1] &quot;0x7f84b7fe2c88&quot; [1] &quot;&lt;0x7f84b7fe2c88&gt;&quot; tracemem[0x7f84b7fe2c88 -&gt; 0x7f84b7fe5288]: tracemem[0x7f84b7fe5288 -&gt; 0x7f84bc0817c8]: What is 0x7f84b7fe5288 when the intermediate x &lt;- c(1L, 2L, 4) is impossible? When we assign the new value as an integer there is no intermediate step. This probably means c(1,2, NA) is the intermediate step; creating an intermediate vector that’s the same length of the final product with NA values at all locations that are new or to be changed x &lt;- c(1L, 2L, 3L) obj_addr(x) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa0598cfa88&quot; tracemem(x) ## [1] &quot;&lt;0x7fa0598cfa88&gt;&quot; x[[3]] &lt;- 4L ## tracemem[0x7fa0598cfa88 -&gt; 0x7fa0596f6bc8]: eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers handle timing_fn evaluate_call &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir block_exec call_block process_group.block process_group withCallingHandlers process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; render_cur_session render_book FUN lapply unlist render_book render_book_script in_dir &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; You can dig into the C code running this: pryr::show_c_source(.Internal(&quot;[&lt;-&quot;)) 2.4.1 Object size If I have two vectors, one 1:10 and another c(1:10, 10), intuitively, I would expect the size of the second vector to be greater than the size of the first. However, it seems to be the other way round, why? x1 &lt;- 1:10 x2 &lt;- rep(1:10, 10) lobstr::obj_size(x1) ## 680 B lobstr::obj_size(x2) ## 448 B If we start with the following three vectors: x1 &lt;- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L, 6L, 7L, 8L, 9L, 10L) x2 &lt;- 1:10 x3 &lt;- rep(1:10, 10) lobstr::obj_sizes(x1, x2, x3) ## * 96 B ## * 680 B ## * 448 B Intuitively, we would have expected x1 &lt; x2 &lt; x3 but this is not the case. It appears that the rep() function coerces a double into integer and hence optimizes on space. Using :, R internally uses ALTREP. ALTREP would actually be more efficient if the numbers represented were significantly large, say 1e7. x4 &lt;- 1:1e7 x5 &lt;- x4 x5[1] &lt;- 1L lobstr::obj_sizes(x4, x5) ## * 680 B ## * 40,000,048 B Now, the size of x4 is significantly lower than that of x5 . This seems to indicate that ALTREP becomes super efficient as the vector size is increased. 2.5.1 Modify-in-place “When it comes to bindings, R can currently only count 0, 1, or many. That means that if an object has two bindings, and one goes away, the reference count does not go back to 1: one less than many is still many. In turn, this means that R will make copies when it sometimes doesn’t need to.” Can we come up with an example of this? It seems really theoretical right now. First you need to switch your Environment tab to something other than global in RStudio! Now we can create a vector: v &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) (old_address &lt;- lobstr::obj_addr(v)) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05af1c148&quot; Changing a value within it changes its address: v[[3]] &lt;- 4 (new_address &lt;- lobstr::obj_addr(v)) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05b0492c8&quot; old_address == new_address ## [1] FALSE We can assign the modified vector to a new name, where y and v point to the same thing. y &lt;- v (y_address &lt;- lobstr::obj_addr(y)) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05b0492c8&quot; (v_address &lt;- lobstr::obj_addr(v)) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05b0492c8&quot; y_address == v_address ## [1] TRUE Now if we modify v it won’t point to the same thing as y: v[[3]] &lt;- 3 (y_address &lt;- lobstr::obj_addr(y)) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05b0492c8&quot; (v_address &lt;- lobstr::obj_addr(v)) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05a1eab38&quot; y_address == v_address ## [1] FALSE But if we now change y to look like v, the original address, in theory editing y should occur in place, but it doesn’t - the “count does not go back to one”! y[[3]] &lt;- 3 (new_y_address &lt;- lobstr::obj_addr(y)) ## [1] &quot;0x7fa05b902ff8&quot; new_y_address == y_address ## [1] FALSE Can we break down this code a bit more? I’d like to really understand when and how it’s copying three times. As of R 4.0 it’s now copied twice, the 3rd copy that’s external to the function is now eliminated!! # dataframe of 5 columns of numbers x &lt;- data.frame(matrix(runif(5 * 1e4), ncol = 5)) # median number for each column medians &lt;- vapply(x, median, numeric(1)) # subtract the median of each column from each value in the column for (i in seq_along(medians)) { x[[i]] &lt;- x[[i]] - medians[[i]] } cat(tracemem(x), &quot;\\n&quot;) &lt;0x7fdc99a6f9a8&gt; for (i in 1:5) { x[[i]] &lt;- x[[i]] - medians[[i]] } tracemem[0x7fdc99a6f9a8 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de83e38]: tracemem[0x7fdc9de83e38 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de83ea8]: [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;- tracemem[0x7fdc9de83ea8 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de83f18]: [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;- tracemem[0x7fdc9de83f18 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de83f88]: tracemem[0x7fdc9de83f88 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de83ff8]: [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;- tracemem[0x7fdc9de83ff8 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de84068]: [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;- tracemem[0x7fdc9de84068 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de840d8]: tracemem[0x7fdc9de840d8 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de84148]: [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;- tracemem[0x7fdc9de84148 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de841b8]: [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;- tracemem[0x7fdc9de841b8 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de84228]: tracemem[0x7fdc9de84228 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de84298]: [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;- tracemem[0x7fdc9de84298 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de84308]: [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;- tracemem[0x7fdc9de84308 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de84378]: tracemem[0x7fdc9de84378 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de843e8]: [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;- tracemem[0x7fdc9de843e8 -&gt; 0x7fdc9de84458]: [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;- When we run tracemem on the for loop above we see each column is copied twice followed by the [[&lt;-.data.frame [[&lt;-, the stack trace showing exactly where the duplication occurred. So what is [[&lt;-.data.frame? It’s a function! By looking at `?[[&lt;-.data.frame we see this is used to “extract or replace subsets of data frames.” When we write x[[i]] &lt;- value, it’s really shorthand for calling the function [[&lt;-.data.frame with inputs x, i, and value. Now let’s step into the call of this base function by running debug(``[[&lt;-.data.frame``): debug(`[[&lt;-.data.frame`) and once inside, use tracemem() to find where the new values are assigned to the column: function (x, i, j, value) { if (!all(names(sys.call()) %in% c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;value&quot;))) warning(&quot;named arguments are discouraged&quot;) cl &lt;- oldClass(x) # this is where another copy of x is made! class(x) &lt;- NULL # tracemem[0x7fdc9d852a18 -&gt; 0x7fdc9c99cc08]: nrows &lt;- .row_names_info(x, 2L) if (is.atomic(value) &amp;&amp; !is.null(names(value))) names(value) &lt;- NULL if (nargs() &lt; 4L) { nc &lt;- length(x) if (!is.null(value)) { N &lt;- NROW(value) if (N &gt; nrows) stop(sprintf(ngettext(N, &quot;replacement has %d row, data has %d&quot;, &quot;replacement has %d rows, data has %d&quot;), N, nrows), domain = NA) if (N &lt; nrows) if (N &gt; 0L &amp;&amp; (nrows%%N == 0L) &amp;&amp; length(dim(value)) &lt;= 1L) value &lt;- rep(value, length.out = nrows) else stop(sprintf(ngettext(N, &quot;replacement has %d row, data has %d&quot;, &quot;replacement has %d rows, data has %d&quot;), N, nrows), domain = NA) } x[[i]] &lt;- value if (length(x) &gt; nc) { nc &lt;- length(x) if (names(x)[nc] == &quot;&quot;) names(x)[nc] &lt;- paste0(&quot;V&quot;, nc) names(x) &lt;- make.unique(names(x)) } class(x) &lt;- cl return(x) } if (missing(i) || missing(j)) stop(&quot;only valid calls are x[[j]] &lt;- value or x[[i,j]] &lt;- value&quot;) rows &lt;- attr(x, &quot;row.names&quot;) nvars &lt;- length(x) if (n &lt;- is.character(i)) { ii &lt;- match(i, rows) n &lt;- sum(new.rows &lt;- is.na(ii)) if (n &gt; 0L) { ii[new.rows] &lt;- seq.int(from = nrows + 1L, length.out = n) new.rows &lt;- i[new.rows] } i &lt;- ii } if (all(i &gt;= 0L) &amp;&amp; (nn &lt;- max(i)) &gt; nrows) { if (n == 0L) { nrr &lt;- (nrows + 1L):nn if (inherits(value, &quot;data.frame&quot;) &amp;&amp; (dim(value)[1L]) &gt;= length(nrr)) { new.rows &lt;- attr(value, &quot;row.names&quot;)[seq_len(nrr)] repl &lt;- duplicated(new.rows) | match(new.rows, rows, 0L) if (any(repl)) new.rows[repl] &lt;- nrr[repl] } else new.rows &lt;- nrr } x &lt;- xpdrows.data.frame(x, rows, new.rows) rows &lt;- attr(x, &quot;row.names&quot;) nrows &lt;- length(rows) } iseq &lt;- seq_len(nrows)[i] if (anyNA(iseq)) stop(&quot;non-existent rows not allowed&quot;) if (is.character(j)) { if (&quot;&quot; %in% j) stop(&quot;column name \\&quot;\\&quot; cannot match any column&quot;) jseq &lt;- match(j, names(x)) if (anyNA(jseq)) stop(gettextf(&quot;replacing element in non-existent column: %s&quot;, j[is.na(jseq)]), domain = NA) } else if (is.logical(j) || min(j) &lt; 0L) jseq &lt;- seq_along(x)[j] else { jseq &lt;- j if (max(jseq) &gt; nvars) stop(gettextf(&quot;replacing element in non-existent column: %s&quot;, jseq[jseq &gt; nvars]), domain = NA) } if (length(iseq) &gt; 1L || length(jseq) &gt; 1L) stop(&quot;only a single element should be replaced&quot;) x[[jseq]][[iseq]] &lt;- value # here is where x is copied again! class(x) &lt;- cl # tracemem[0x7fdc992ae9d8 -&gt; 0x7fdc9be55258]: x } Thus seeing exactly where the three as of R 4.0: two! copies are happening.

A sentinel value (also referred to as a flag value, trip value, rogue value, signal value, or dummy data) is a special value in the context of an algorithm which uses its presence as a condition of termination. Also worth noting two NAs are not equal to each other! For instance, in C++ there’s a special character to identify the end of a string I think another example of a sentinel value might be in surveys where you sometimes see missing data or N/A coded as 999, or 9999 (or maybe just 9) Another example of a sentinel value might be in surveys where you sometimes see missing data or N/A coded as 999, or 9999 (or maybe just 9). The possible values in a column of data might be: factor(c(1,1,1,1,2,3,3,4,4,9), levels = c(1,2,3,4,9)) Sentinels are typically employed in situations where it’s easier/preferable to have a collection of values of the same type - represented internally using the same conventions and requiring the same amount of memory - but you also need a way to indicate a special circumstance. So like in the case of survey data you may, for example, see a variable indicating that an individual is 999 years old but the correct way to interpret that is that the data was not collected. 3.2.4 Testing and coercion Why does the book warn us against using is.vector(), is.atomic() and is.numeric()? [read docs] is.atomic will also return true if NULL is.numeric tests if integer or double NOT factor, Date, POSIXt, difftime is.vector will return false if it has attributes other than names 3.3.1 Setting Attributes Working in the medical field I have to import SAS files a lot where the column names have to adhere to specific abbreviations so they’re given a label attribute for their full name. What are some other common uses for attributes? Hypothesis test attributes! 3.3.2 setNames We can use setNames to apply different values to each element in a vector. How do we do this for our own custom attribute? The code below does NOT work! my_vector &lt;- c( structure(1, x = &quot;firstatt_1&quot;), structure(2, x = &quot;firstatt_2&quot;), structure(3, x = &quot;firstatt_3&quot;) ) my_vector &lt;- setNames(my_vector, c(&quot;name_1&quot;, &quot;name_2&quot;, &quot;name_3&quot;)) # mental model: shouldn&#39;t this should return $names and $x? attributes(my_vector) ## $names ## [1] &quot;name_1&quot; &quot;name_2&quot; &quot;name_3&quot; As soon as you instantiate a vector the attributes are lost. BUT we can store it as a list within the vector to keep them! We can create a custom attribute function and use that with map to add a list inside our dataframe: custom_attr &lt;- function(x, my_attr) { attr(x, &quot;x&quot;) &lt;- my_attr return(x) } as_tb &lt;- tibble( one = c(1,2,3), x = c(&quot;att_1&quot;, &quot;att_2&quot;, &quot;att_3&quot;), with_arr = map2(one, x, ~custom_attr(.x, .y)) ) as_tb$with_arr ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## attr(,&quot;x&quot;) ## [1] &quot;att_1&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 2 ## attr(,&quot;x&quot;) ## [1] &quot;att_2&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 3 ## attr(,&quot;x&quot;) ## [1] &quot;att_3&quot; 3.3.3 Dimensions Because NROW and NCOL don’t return NULL on a one dimensional vector they just seem to me as a more flexible option. When do you have to use ncol and nrow? It may be better practice to always use NROW and NCOL! As long as the number of rows matches the data frame, it’s also possible to have a matrix or array as a column of a data frame. (This requires a slight extension to our definition of a data frame: it’s not the length() of each column that must be equal, but the NROW().) df &lt;- data.frame(x = c(1,2,3,4,5), y = c(letters[1:5])) length(df$y) == NROW(df$y) ## [1] TRUE What’s an example of where length() != NROW() The case of a matrix! my_matrix &lt;- 1:6 dim(my_matrix) &lt;- c(3,2) my_matrix ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 4 ## [2,] 2 5 ## [3,] 3 6 length(my_matrix) == NROW(my_matrix) # 6 != 3 ## [1] FALSE length(my_matrix) == NCOL(my_matrix) # 6 != 2 ## [1] FALSE The length of the matrix is 6, and if we manipulate the dimensions of the matrix we see that the NROW is 3 and and NCOL is 2. 3.4 S3 atomic vectors How is data type typeof() different from class()? Classes are built on top of base types - they’re like special, more specific kinds of types. In fact, if a class isn’t specified then class() will default to either the implicit class or typeof. So Date, POSIXct, and difftime are specific kinds of doubles, falling under its umbrella. lubridate::is.Date(Sys.Date()) ## [1] TRUE is.double(Sys.Date()) ## [1] TRUE lubridate::is.POSIXct(Sys.time()) ## [1] TRUE is.double(Sys.time()) ## [1] TRUE lubridate::is.difftime(as.difftime(c(&quot;0:3:20&quot;, &quot;11:23:15&quot;))) ## [1] TRUE is.double(as.difftime(c(&quot;0:3:20&quot;, &quot;11:23:15&quot;))) ## [1] TRUE But then why does my_factor fail to be recognized under its more general integer umbrella? my_factor &lt;- factor(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)) is.factor(my_factor) ## [1] TRUE is.integer(my_factor) ## [1] FALSE XXX 3.4.2 Dates Why are dates calculated from January 1st, 1970? Unix counts time in seconds since its official “birthday,” – called “epoch” in computing terms – which is Jan. 1, 1970. This article explains that the early Unix engineers picked that date arbitrarily, because they needed to set a uniform date for the start of time, and New Year’s Day, 1970, seemed most convenient. 3.5.1 Lists When should you be using list() instead of c() It’s really contingent on the use case. In the case of adding custom classes it’s worth noting that those are lost once you c() those objects together! 3.6.8 Data frames and tibbles What does ‘lazy’ mean in terms of as_tibble? Technically lazy evaluation means that expressions are not evaluated when they are bound to variables, but their evaluation is deferred until their results are needed by other computations. In this context though we think Hadley just meant that it’s treated as a character if it “looks and smells like a character”.

I don’t see a space! After running debug(as.matrix(df_coltypes)) and going down a rabbit hole we found this is a bug that has been addressed! See issue here Conclusion How does vectorization make your code faster Taking the example from Efficient R Programming: VECTORIZED: sum(log(x)) NON-VECTORIZED: s &lt;- 0 for(x0 in x) { s &lt;- s + log(x0) } The vectorized code is faster because it obeys the golden rule of R programming: “access the underlying C/Fortran routines as quickly as possible; the fewer functions calls required to achieve this, the better”. Vectorized Version: sum [called once] log [called once] Non-vectorized: + [called length(x) times] log [called length(x) times] In the vectorised version, there are two primitive function calls: one to log (which performs length(x) steps in the C level) and one to sum (which performs x updates in the C level). So you end up doing a similar number of operations at C level regardless of the route. In the non-vectorised form you are passing the logic back and forth between R and C many many times and this is why the non-vectorised form is much slower. A vectorized function calls primitives directly, but a loop calls each function length(x) times, and there are 1 + length(x) assignments to s. Theres on the order of 3x primitive function calls in the non-vectorised form!! Resources: Check out Jenny Brian’s slides Great article by Noam Ross Putting it all together in a single diagram: "],

[[, $. What is the distinction between an operator and a function? When you look up the help page it brings up the same page for all three extraction methods. What are their distinctions and do their definitions change based on what you’re subsetting? Can we make a table? [ [[ $ ATOMIC RETURNS VECTOR WITH ONE ELEMENT SAME AS [ NOPE! LIST RETURNS A LIST RETURNS SINGLE ELEMENT FROM WITHIN LIST RETURN SINGLE ELEMENT FROM LIST [CAN ONLY USE WHEN LIST VECTOR HAS A NAME] MATRIX RETURNS A VECTOR RETURNS A VECTOR OR SINGLE VALUE NOPE! DATA FRAME RETURNS A VECTOR OR DATA FRAME RETURNS VECTOR/LIST/MATRIX OR SINGLE VALUE RETURNS VECTOR/LIST/MATRIX USING COLUMN NAME TIBBLE RETURNS A TIBBLE RETURNS A VECTOR OR SINGLE VALUE RETURNS THE STR OF THE COLUMN - TIBBLE/LIST/MATRIX If we think of everything as sets (which have the properties of 0,1, or many elements), if the set has 1 element it only contains itself and NULL subsets. Before you subset using [ or [[ count the elements in the set. If it has zero elements you are done, if it has one element [ will return itself - to go further you need to use [[ to return its contents. If there is more than one element in the set then [ will return those elements. You can read more about subsetting here 4.2.1 Selecting multiple elements Why is numeric(0) “helpful for test data?” This is more of a general comment that one should make sure one’s code doesn’t crash with vectors of zero length (or data frames with zero rows) Why is subsetting with factors “not a good idea” Hadley’s notes seem to say subsetting with factors uses the “integer vector of levels” - and if they all have the same level, it’ll just return the first argument. Subsetting a factor vector leaves the factor levels behind unless you explicitly drop the unused levels 4.2.2 lists We’ve been talking about $ as a shorthand for [[. Using the example list x &lt;- list(1:3, &quot;a&quot;, 4:6) can we use x$1 as shorthand for x[[1]]? The “shorthand” refers to using the name of the vector to extract the vector. If we give 1:3 a name such as test = 1:3 x &lt;- list(named_vector = 1:3, &quot;a&quot;, 4:6) x[[1]] == x$named_vector ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE As such, $ is a shorthand for x[[&quot;name_of_vector&quot;]] and not shorthand for x[[index]] 4.3.1 [[ The book states: While you must use [[ when working with lists, I’d also recommend using it with atomic vectors whenever you want to extract a single value. For example, instead of writing: for (i in 2:length(x)) { out[i] &lt;- fun(x[i], out[i - 1]) } It’s better to write for (i in 2:length(x)) { out[[i]] &lt;- fun(x[[i]], out[[i - 1]]) } Why? Can we see this in action by giving x, out, and fun real life values? If we have a vector df_x &lt;- c(&quot;Advanced&quot;,&quot;R&quot;,&quot;Book&quot;,&quot;Club&quot;) We can use [ or [[ to extract the third element of df_x df_x[3] ## [1] &quot;Book&quot; df_x[[3]] ## [1] &quot;Book&quot; But in the case where we want to extract an element from a list [ and [[ no longer give us the same results df_x &lt;- list(A = &quot;Advanced&quot;, B = &quot;R&quot;, C = &quot;Book&quot;, D = &quot;Club&quot;) df_x[3] ## $C ## [1] &quot;Book&quot; df_x[[3]] ## [1] &quot;Book&quot; Because using [[ returns “one element of this vector” in both cases, it makes sense to default to [[ instead of [ since it will reliably return a single element. 4.3.5 Exercise The question asks to describe the upper.tri function - let’s dig into it! x &lt;- outer(1:5, 1:5, FUN = &quot;*&quot;) upper.tri(x) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [2,] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [3,] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE ## [4,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [5,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE We see that it returns the upper triangle of the matrix.

It’s a compact, special purpose equivalent” What is meant here by “special purpose”? Can we come up with a case where you can’t substitute if for switch or the other way around? Use switch. Is it safe to say to switch when you have character inputs (as the book suggests) and use case_when or if for numerics? Switch is special in that only ONE value can be true, as in the case from our presentation the shiny input can only ever be ONE of the strings on the left it cannot be multiple. datasetInput &lt;- reactive({ switch(input$dataset, &quot;materials&quot; = brewing_materials, &quot;size&quot; = brewer_size, &quot;states&quot; = beer_states, &quot;taxed&quot; = beer_taxed) }) 5.3.1 common pitfalls What does the book mean by leveraging vector for preallocating the loop output? How is this different from creating an empty list to instantiate the loop? means &lt;- c(1, 50, 20) out_vector &lt;- vector(&quot;list&quot;, length(means)) for (i in 1:length(means)) { out_vector[[i]] &lt;- rnorm(10, means[[i]]) } out_list &lt;- list() for (i in 1:length(means)) { out_list[[i]] &lt;- rnorm(10, means[[i]]) } By preallocating the length of the out_vector we’re leveraging modify-in-place rather than copy-on-modify. The book warns against using length(x) and suggests using seq_along instead. Is there any downside to using seq_along or a case when you’d prefer length(x) over seq_along(x)? I can’t think of any downsides to using it! We have yet to find a downside but should look into this further! 5.3.3.1 Exercises x &lt;- numeric() out &lt;- vector(&quot;list&quot;, length(x)) for (i in 1:length(x)) { out[i] &lt;- x[i] ^ 2 } out ## [[1]] ## [1] NA I understand that this works because we can count down in a loop - so the first iteration x[1] == NA, and the second x[2] == numeric(0) but where does this value go? Is it just evaluated but not stored since R counts from 1? This question is actually the bigger question, “Can you assign something to index 0 in R?” and it doesn’t seem that you can. Assignment to a valid index mylist = list() mylist[1] &lt;- c(&quot;something&quot;) mylist[1] ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;something&quot; Assignment to [0] mylist = list() mylist[0] &lt;- c(&quot;something&quot;) mylist[0] ## list() It’s interesting that it’s syntactically correct to assign to mylist[0] but it does nothing! Empty index mylist = list() mylist[1] ## [[1]] ## NULL R defaultly accesses the first layer using [ and says there are no elements in the first layer of mylist and returns NULL. But when you do mylist[[1]] R says Out of Bounds because the first layer of mylist has been called and there is no layer at all. That’s why R throws error in [[ case. Impossible Index [[ mylist = list() mylist[[0]] Error in mylist[[0]] : attempt to select less than one element in get1index &lt;real&gt; [[ isolates one element whereas [ can be used to get subsets of varying sizes. [[ gets precisely one element, no more no less, or it fails. So [[0]]&lt;- cannot work because index zero cannot hold a value. Impossible Index [[&lt;- mylist = list() mylist[[0]] &lt;- &quot;something&quot; Error in mylist[[0]] &lt;- &quot;something&quot; : attempt to select less than one element in integerOneIndex Undefined name Selection using an undefined - but possible name - gives NULL mylist = list() mylist[[&quot;undefined_name&quot;]] Out of Bounds Selection using a possible - but not currently allocated - index gives an out of bounds error mylist = list() mylist[[10]] Error in mylist[[10]] : subscript out of bounds Conclusion Can we put these concepts together in diagram form? Let’s work on improving these schematics! Let’s first put functions into words: If condition then run code, else quit A vectorized version of: if condition then run code, else run other code For every element in list of elements do what is in between the curly braces While this condition is true do this Repeat this until something tells you to break out We can visualize how the ifelse logic on a single element above will operate on each element within a vector: For instance if we can run: ifelse(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 1:2, 3) ## [1] 1 3 1 Lets break down what’s happening: Create a test answer: test &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) yes &lt;- 1:2 no &lt;- 3 which indices in the test are TRUE and which are FALSE yes_idx &lt;- which(test) # 1,3 no_idx &lt;- which(!test) # 2 set up our answer answer &lt;- test # T, F, T grow the yes and no answers to the length of the test (input) yes_final &lt;- rep(yes, length.out = length(test)) no_final &lt;- rep(no, length.out = length(test)) fill the answer with yes or no from the enlarged yes/no answers answer[yes_idx] &lt;- yes_final[yes_idx] # 1,1 answer[no_idx] &lt;- no_final[no_idx] # 3 return our final answer: answer ## [1] 1 3 1 Another example: we can run ifelse(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE), 1:10, &quot;FALSE&quot;) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot; we can see that ifelse places the numbers in 1:10 based on their index where our condition is to TRUE and inserts the string &quot;FALSE&quot; whenever the condition is FALSE Complexity Cyclomatic complexity is a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program. It is computed using the control flow graph of the program: the nodes of the graph correspond to indivisible groups of commands of a program, and a directed edge connects two nodes if the second command might be executed immediately after the first command. We can use the package cyclocomp to look at the cyclomatic complexity of functions. Looking at each function from the Chapter 5 presentation: controlflow_functions &lt;- list( if_func = if_func, if_else_func = if_else_func, ifelse_func = ifelse_func, casewhen_func = casewhen_func, switch_func = switch_func, for_func = for_func, while_func = while_func, repeat_func = repeat_func) purrr::map_df(controlflow_functions, cyclocomp) ## # A tibble: 1 x 8 ## if_func if_else_func ifelse_func casewhen_func switch_func for_func while_func ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 2 2 1 1 1 23 3 ## # … with 1 more variable: repeat_func &lt;int&gt; We see that the for loop was our most complex function and while had a complexity of 3. The rest of our functions had a complexity of 1. As Colin Fay states: “Splitting a complex function into smaller functions is not a magic solution because (A) the global complexity of the app is not lowered by splitting things into pieces (just local complexity), and (B) the deeper the call stack, the harder it can be to debug.” "],

What does that process look like? I think this is a bigger question of digging into the relationship between C and R. Primitives are part of R core, and can only be written by the R-core team. At its heart, R is the set of primitive C functions underneath it. You can use Rcpp to include C++ code in your R code, but these aren’t Primitives. There are also other techniques which we’ll likely see covered in later chapters. Here’s an example using Rcpp. Rcpp::cppFunction(&#39;#include&lt;string&gt; std::string IPA() { std::string val = &quot;IPAs suck&quot;; return val; }&#39;) val &lt;- IPA() val ## [1] &quot;IPAs suck&quot; Are there any non-base primitives? If so how is that possible! XXX 6.2.5.1 Exercises This question is flagged as “started” let’s try to complete it! Q: Given a name, like &quot;mean&quot;, match.fun() lets you find a function. Given a function, can you find its name? Why doesn’t that make sense in R? A: A name can only point to a single object, but an object can be pointed to by 0, 1, or many names. What are names of the functions in the following block? function(x) sd(x) / mean(x) ## function(x) sd(x) / mean(x) f1 &lt;- function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)) f2 &lt;- f1 f3 &lt;- f1 There isn’t a 1 to 1 mapping between functions and names in R. Multiple names may point to the same function as we see for f1, f2, and f3. Also, each function has its own environment so it’s possible that two functions might have the same “code” but are not the same because they have different environments (or closures). Lastly, anonymous functions don’t have names so we’d have no way to look these up. We could find the names of our functions if they are all in the global environment using body(x) == body(y) names(which(sapply(mget(lsf.str()), function(x) body(x) == body(function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))))) [1] f1 f2 f3 But that’s just deparsing the body into a string and comparing the values. So if you want to think of two functions as being equal if their deparsed body strings as the same, then that’s technically possible but that is just like searching for every variable that has the value of 5 [possible but not efficient]. The main point is that name -&gt; object is a one way (non-unique) look up in R. There’s no efficient way to go backwards. This is true for all values, not just functions. 6.3 Function composition When comparing nested, intermediate, and piping functions, it looks like Hadley flips the order of f() and g() between bullet points It does look like he does that! f &lt;- function(z) { cat(&quot;g is:&quot;, z) } g &lt;- function(x) { x * 2 } 6.0.1 Nested f(g(2)) ## g is: 4 6.0.2 Intermediate This is written in the book as y &lt;- f(x); g(y) but should be flipped to y &lt;- g(x); f(y) if we are to follow the nested example y &lt;- g(2) f(y) ## g is: 4 6.0.3 Piping This also needs to be flipped from x %&gt;% f() %&gt;% g() to x %&gt;% g() %&gt;% f() 2 %&gt;% g() %&gt;% f() ## g is: 4 6.4 Lexical scoping “The scoping rules use a parse-time, rather than a run-time structure”? What is “parse-time” and “run-time”? How do they differ? parse-time is when the function gets defined: when the formals and body get set. run-time is when it actually gets called. This function doesn’t get past parse-time because of the syntax error get_state &lt;- function(in_df, state_name){ out_df % in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ] return(out_df) } get_state &lt;- function(in_df, state_name){ out_df % in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ] Error: unexpected input in: &quot;get_state &lt;- function(in_df, state_name){ out_df % in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ]&quot; return(out_df) Error: object &#39;out_df&#39; not found } Error: unexpected &#39;}&#39; in &quot;}&quot; This function will get parsed successfully but could fail at run at run-time if the input data frame doesn’t have a column named state: get_state &lt;- function(in_df, state_name){ out_df &lt;- in_df[in_df$state == state_name, ] return(out_df) } get_state(iris, &#39;setosa&#39;) ## [1] Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## &lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names) At R’s build-time, if you want to run a function from a package that isn’t loaded it will not throw an error but at run-time it will if the required package is not loaded: func_1 &lt;- function(df, x) { select({{ df }}, {{ x }}) } test_tbl &lt;- tibble::tibble(x1 = runif(5), x2 = rnorm(5), x3 = rpois(5, lambda = 1)) Without dplyr this will fail func_1(test_tbl, x1) Error in select({: could not find function &quot;select&quot; This will work: library(dplyr) #&gt; #&gt; Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; #&gt; The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: #&gt; #&gt; filter, lag #&gt; The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: #&gt; #&gt; intersect, setdiff, setequal, union func_1(test_tbl, x1) ## # A tibble: 5 x 1 ## x1 ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.960 ## 2 0.311 ## 3 0.853 ## 4 0.589 ## 5 0.813 6.4.3 A fresh start How would we change this code so that the second call of g11() is 2? g11 &lt;- function() { if (!exists(&quot;a&quot;)) { a &lt;- 1 } else { a &lt;- a + 1 } a } g11() ## [1] 1 g11 &lt;- function() { if (!exists(&quot;a&quot;)) { a &lt;- 1 } else { a &lt;- a + 1 } a &lt;&lt;- a a } g11() ## [1] 1 6.5 Lazy evaluation “This allows you to do things like include potentially expensive computations in function arguments that will only be evaluated if needed” Does anyone have an example of this?

I am still reading this as: h03(double(20), double(20)) which is an incorrect mental model because the message is only printed once… double &lt;- function(x) { message(&quot;Calculating...&quot;) x * 2 } h03 &lt;- function(x) { c(x, x) } Explain what’s happeining here below in words, and restructure the promise image to make more sense double &lt;- function(y) { message(&quot;Calculating...&quot;) cat(&quot;double before\\n&quot;) print(pryr::promise_info(y)) force(y) cat(&quot;double after\\n&quot;) print(pryr::promise_info(y)) y * 2 } h03 &lt;- function(x) { cat(paste0(&quot;h03 before\\n&quot;)) print(pryr::promise_info(x)) force(x) cat(&quot;h03 after\\n&quot;) print(pryr::promise_info(x)) c(x, x) } double(h03(20)) ## Calculating... ## double before ## Registered S3 method overwritten by &#39;pryr&#39;: ## method from ## print.bytes Rcpp ## $code ## h03(20) ## ## $env ## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## ## $evaled ## [1] FALSE ## ## $value ## NULL ## ## h03 before ## $code ## [1] 20 ## ## $env ## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## ## $evaled ## [1] FALSE ## ## $value ## NULL ## ## h03 after ## $code ## [1] 20 ## ## $env ## NULL ## ## $evaled ## [1] TRUE ## ## $value ## [1] 20 ## ## double after ## $code ## h03(20) ## ## $env ## NULL ## ## $evaled ## [1] TRUE ## ## $value ## [1] 20 20 ## [1] 40 40 plop &lt;- function(a, b) a * 10 plop(2, var_doesnt_exist) ## [1] 20 var_doesnt_exist is a promise within g, we use the promises within g when we call f but f never uses its second argument so this runs without a problem. When would we want to leverage this behavior? The unevaluated var_doesnt_exist doesn’t exist , but we can use substitute to to get the expression out of a promise! If we modify our function we can play with the expression contained in b: plop &lt;- function(a, b) { cat(&quot;You entered&quot;, deparse(substitute(b)), &quot;as `b` \\n&quot;) a * 10 } plop(a = 2, b = var_doesnt_exist) ## You entered var_doesnt_exist as `b` ## [1] 20 We can even evaluate b and use it to create a dplyr like pull function: plop &lt;- function(a, b) { eval(substitute(b), envir = a) } plop(iris, Species)[1:10] ## [1] setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa ## Levels: setosa versicolor virginica 6.5.2 Default arguments I don’t quite understand why x = ls() is different from ls() here; aren’t we still assigning x = ls() but without specifying x? h05 &lt;- function(x = ls()) { a &lt;- 1 x } # this makes sense to me h05() ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;x&quot; # how is this different from above? h05(ls()) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;answer&quot; &quot;as_tb&quot; ## [4] &quot;casewhen_func&quot; &quot;controlflow_functions&quot; &quot;custom_attr&quot; ## [7] &quot;df&quot; &quot;df_coltypes&quot; &quot;df_non_syntactic_name&quot; ## [10] &quot;df_x&quot; &quot;double&quot; &quot;example2223&quot; ## [13] &quot;f&quot; &quot;f1&quot; &quot;f2&quot; ## [16] &quot;f3&quot; &quot;for_func&quot; &quot;func_1&quot; ## [19] &quot;g&quot; &quot;g11&quot; &quot;get_state&quot; ## [22] &quot;h03&quot; &quot;h05&quot; &quot;i&quot; ## [25] &quot;if_else_func&quot; &quot;if_func&quot; &quot;ifelse_func&quot; ## [28] &quot;IPA&quot; &quot;l1&quot; &quot;l2&quot; ## [31] &quot;means&quot; &quot;medians&quot; &quot;mega_model&quot; ## [34] &quot;my_factor&quot; &quot;my_matrix&quot; &quot;my_set&quot; ## [37] &quot;my_vector&quot; &quot;mylist&quot; &quot;new_address&quot; ## [40] &quot;new_y_address&quot; &quot;no&quot; &quot;no_final&quot; ## [43] &quot;no_idx&quot; &quot;old_address&quot; &quot;out&quot; ## [46] &quot;out_list&quot; &quot;out_vector&quot; &quot;plop&quot; ## [49] &quot;repeat_func&quot; &quot;subsetting_table&quot; &quot;switch_func&quot; ## [52] &quot;test&quot; &quot;test_tbl&quot; &quot;true_one&quot; ## [55] &quot;true_two&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;v_address&quot; ## [58] &quot;val&quot; &quot;var&quot; &quot;while_func&quot; ## [61] &quot;x&quot; &quot;x1&quot; &quot;x2&quot; ## [64] &quot;x3&quot; &quot;x4&quot; &quot;x5&quot; ## [67] &quot;y&quot; &quot;y_address&quot; &quot;yes&quot; ## [70] &quot;yes_final&quot; &quot;yes_idx&quot; The difference is where the promise is created. ls() is always evaluated inside h05 when x is evaluated. The difference is the environment. When ls() is provided as an explicit parameter, x is a promise whose environment is the global environment. When ls() is a default parameter, it is evaluated in the local environment where it is used. Hypothesis: does nesting ls() in h05 first evaluate ls() then evaluate h05() ? library(magrittr) h05 &lt;- function(x = {y &lt;- 4;ls()}) { a &lt;- 1 x } h05() [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; ls() [1] &quot;h05&quot; {y &lt;- 4;ls()} %&gt;% h05() [1] &quot;h05&quot; &quot;y&quot; ls() [1] &quot;h05&quot; &quot;y&quot; h05({x &lt;- 5;ls()}) [1] &quot;h05&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; ls() [1] &quot;h05&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; Notice in all of the latter calls, a is not returned - so it’s not evaluating ls() inside of the function. 6.5.4.3 Exercise I understand this problem is showing us an example of name masking (the function doesn’t need to use the y = 0 argument because it gets y from within the definition of x, but I’m fuzzy on what exactly the ; does. What does the syntax {y &lt;- 1; 2} mean? Could it be read as &quot;Set y &lt;- 1 and x &lt;- 2? y &lt;- 10 f1 &lt;- function(x = {y &lt;- 1; 2}, y = 0) { c(x, y) } f1() ## [1] 2 1 The curly brackets are an expression, which can be read as { y &lt;- 1 2 } ## [1] 2 This is returning 2 and setting 1 to y. The colon can be read as a new line in the expression. x is called inside the function and overwrites the argument value of y f1 &lt;- function(x = {y &lt;- 1; 2}, y = 0) { # At this point, neither x nor y have been needed or evaluated. This is &quot;lazy&quot;. cat(y) # &quot;Summon the current state of y&quot;. # R looks first in the function env - is there a y there? No # R then looks at the arguments - is there a y there? Yes, it&#39;s 0 -&gt; print out zero # If R had not found y in the arguments, then it would look in the parent environment of the function - the global env. # That&#39;s where it would find y = NULL - but since it already found a default arg, it already stopped evaluating. cat(x) # &quot;Summon the current state of x&quot; # x is an expression that first sets y to equal 1 and then returns the number 2 -&gt; print out 2 c(x, # &quot;Summon the current state of x&quot; - x is still the expression that sets y to 1 and then x to 2 y) # &quot;Summon the current state of y&quot; - y was set to 1, so y is 1 here. } f1() ## 02 ## [1] 2 1 Compare to: f1 &lt;- function(x = {y &lt;- 1; 2}, y = 0) { c(y, # &quot;Summon the current state of y&quot; - y has not yet been set to anything else, so it returns zero x) # &quot;Summon the current state of x&quot; - x is still the expression that sets y to 1 and then x to 2 # However, y has already been returned - so even though y is now set to 1, it&#39;s called after the previous y and does not affect the previous y. } x = NULL y = NULL f1() ## [1] 0 2 What is happening here: - The default value of x is “assign 1 to y then return 2 implicitly.” - The default value of y is 0. - x and y aren’t their defaults until they’re referenced and there isn’t a value, so when you invoke the question x is the default, but y is never the default. - When you get to c(x, x is evaluated. Now the value of y is 1 instead of its default value! - When you get to c(x, y), y is now 1, so the return is 2 1 Using the original f1 function, if we write f1(x &lt;- 5) we get 5 0, When you make that call, the function’s x argument gets set to x &lt;- 5 (instead of the default). When you get to c(x, the x &lt;- 5 call gets evaluated in the calling environment (global, most likely, unless you’re calling it from inside a function or something). To see where x gets assigned, try this: f2 &lt;- function(x = {y &lt;- 1; 2}, y = 0) { # c(x, y) &quot;Nothing to see here.&quot; } f2(x &lt;- 5) ## [1] &quot;Nothing to see here.&quot; x ## Error: object &#39;x&#39; not found Since x is never used in this version, the x = {x &lt;- 5} promise never gets evaluated, so x never gets set in the calling environment. But if you do the same thing with f1, x is now 5 in the calling environment. Also note that calling the &lt;- function returns the value (the second argument) invisibly, so y &lt;- {x &lt;- 5} assigns 5 to both y and x. I wouldn’t recommend ever doing this on purpose, but it’s useful to know for debugging weird cases. A piece that ALMOST confused me was that the function’s default value only ever “exists” in the function’s environment, not in the calling environment, so the original case doesn’t change y to 1 globally. But f1({y &lt;- 1; 2}) WILL change y globally… but does not change the value of y inside the function. 6.5.4.4 Exercise I know this isn’t exactly needed to answer the question, but how do we access a function that has methods? For instance - here I want to dig into the hist function using hist hist ## function (x, ...) ## UseMethod(&quot;hist&quot;) ## &lt;bytecode: 0x7fa052b745c8&gt; ## &lt;environment: namespace:graphics&gt; does not give me the actual contents of the actual function…. We need to access is using hist.&lt;method&gt; hist.default 6.6 dot dot dot “(See also rlang::list2() to support splicing and to silently ignore trailing commas…” Can we come up with a simple use case for list2 here? The docs use list2(a = 1, a = 2, b = 3, b = 4, 5, 6) but how is this different from list? identical( rlang::list2(a = 1, a = 2, b = 3, b = 4, 5, 6) , list(a = 1, a = 2, b = 3, b = 4, 5, 6) ) ## [1] TRUE list2 is most helpful when we need to force environment variables with data variables. We can see this by creating a function that takes a variable number of arguments: library(rlang) numeric_list &lt;- function(...) { dots &lt;- list(...) num &lt;- as.numeric(dots) set_names(num, names(dots)) } numeric_list2 &lt;- function(...) { dots &lt;- list2(...) num &lt;- as.numeric(dots) set_names(num, names(dots)) } numeric_list(1, 2, 3) ## [1] 1 2 3 numeric_list2(1, 2, 3) ## [1] 1 2 3 The main difference with list(…) is that list2(…) enables the !!! syntax to splice lists: x &lt;- list(2, 3) numeric_list2(1, !!! x, 4) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 numeric_list(1, !!! x, 4) Error in !x : invalid argument type “lapply() uses ... to pass na.rm on to mean()” Um, how? x &lt;- list(c(1, 3, NA), c(4, NA, 6)) str(lapply(x, mean, na.rm = TRUE)) ## List of 2 ## $ : num 2 ## $ : num 5 An lapply takes on two main arguments: what you want to loop over and the function to apply to each element. By including ... lapply allows you to supply additional arguments which will be passed to the function inside the lapply. In this case, na.rm = TRUE is being applied to mean every time it’s being called in the loop. 6.6.1.2 Exercise I tried running browser(plot(1:10, col = &quot;red&quot;)) to peek under the hood but only got Called from: top level in the console. What am I missing? We can use debugonce! debugonce(plot()) 6.7.4 Exit handlers “Always set add = TRUE when using on.exit() If you don’t, each call to on.exit() will overwrite the previous exit handler.” What does this mean? add = TRUE is important when you have more than one on.exit function! j08 &lt;- function() { on.exit(message(&quot;a&quot;)) on.exit(message(&quot;b&quot;), add=TRUE) } j08() ## a ## b Can we go over this code? How does it not change your working directory after you run the function cleanup &lt;- function(dir, code) { old_dir &lt;- setwd(dir) on.exit(setwd(old_dir), add = TRUE) old_opt &lt;- options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) on.exit(options(old_opt), add = TRUE) } cleanup(&quot;~&quot;) getwd() ## [1] &quot;/Users/mayagans/Documents/bookclub-Advanced_R/QandA&quot; The behavior of setwd “changing the working directory” is actually a side effect of the function - it invisibly returns the previous working directory as the value of the function (potentially for the exact purpose demonstrated). We can use this within our on.exit function to change back to the prior working directory! If on.exit fails will it continue onto the next on.exit so long as add == TRUE ?``on.exit fails it’ll continue onto the next one f &lt;- function() { on.exit(stop(&quot;Error&quot;)) on.exit(message(&quot;yay, still called.&quot;), add = TRUE) } f() Error in f() : Error yay, still called. 6.7.5.4 Exercise This question is flagged as “started” let’s try to complete it! Hadley comments in the repo: “I think I’m more interested in supplying a path vs. a logical value here”. Q: How does the chdir parameter of source() compare to with_dir()? Why might you prefer one approach to the other? The with_dir() approach was given in the book as in_dir &lt;- function(dir, code) { old &lt;- setwd(dir) on.exit(setwd(old)) force(code) } A: with_dir() takes a path to a working directory as an argument. First the working directory is changed accordingly. on.exit() ensures that the modification to the working directory are reset to the initial value when the function exits. with_dir gives you the flexibility to change the path to wherever you want (maybe a parent-level folder) whereas source(chdir=TRUE) changes the path to “where that file lives specifically”. Given the following file structure: Imagine I want to run import_data.R, but it needs to reference images/controlflow.png. we can do this by setting the wd to advRbookclub: with_dir(&quot;/advRbookclub/data/import_data.R&quot;,&quot;/advRbookclub&quot;) Or we can use: source(&quot;/advRbookclub/data/import_data.R&quot;, chdir=TRUE) but then, we’d need to include something like setwd(here::here()) in import_data.R so that it goes back to AdvancedR.Rproj and sets the working directory there. In conclusion: source is a base R function so reduces dependencies. Once set, you could use setwd(&quot;..&quot;)assuming you can have some confidence that it’s part of a repository or something? with_dir is exported from the withr package but is a more fine-tuned control by passing the specific folder name as opposed to a boolean TRUE | FALSE. 6.7.5.5 Exercise Can we go over the source code of capture.output and capture.output2? There were several new terms here to me when going over this function: stderr error output stdout normal output #!/usr/bin/env Rscript # redirect.r -- experiments with warning and error messages # Get any arguments (and ignore them) arguments &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE) # Default write(&quot;1) write() to stderr&quot;, stderr()) write(&quot;1) write() to stdout&quot;, stdout()) warning(&quot;1) warning()&quot;) # Ignore all warnings options(warn = -1) write(&quot;2) write() to stderr&quot;, stderr()) write(&quot;2) write() to stdout&quot;, stdout()) warning(&quot;2) warning()&quot;) # Send all STDERR to STDOUT using sink() options(warn = 0) # default setting sink(stdout(), type=&quot;message&quot;) write(&quot;3) write() to stderr&quot;, stderr()) write(&quot;3) write() to stdout&quot;, stdout()) warning(&quot;3) warning()&quot;) # Send all STDOUT to STDERR using sink() sink(NULL, type=&quot;message&quot;) # default setting sink(stderr(), type=&quot;output&quot;) write(&quot;4) write() to stderr&quot;, stderr()) write(&quot;4) write() to stdout&quot;, stdout()) warning(&quot;4) warning()&quot;) # Send messages and output to separate files msg &lt;- file(&quot;message.Rout&quot;, open=&quot;wt&quot;) out &lt;- file(&quot;output.Rout&quot;, open=&quot;wt&quot;) sink(msg, type=&quot;message&quot;) sink(out, type=&quot;output&quot;) write(&quot;5) write() to stderr&quot;, stderr()) write(&quot;5) write() to stdout&quot;, stdout()) warning(&quot;5) warning()&quot;) sink diverts R output to a connection. zz &lt;- file(&quot;all.Rout&quot;, open = &quot;wt&quot;) sink(zz) sink(zz, type = &quot;message&quot;) try(log(&quot;a&quot;)) ## revert output back to the console -- only then access the file! sink(type = &quot;message&quot;) sink() file.show(&quot;all.Rout&quot;) textConnection allows R character vectors to be read as if they were being read from a text file. They can capture R output to a character vector They can be used to create a new character object or append to an existing one in the user’s workspace.

It uses two exit handlers, one to clean up the temporary file, and one to remove the sink. 6.8.4 Replacement functions Can we put into words the translation for x &lt;- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3) names(x) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; names(x)[2] &lt;- &quot;two&quot; names(x) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;two&quot; &quot;c&quot; Being equal to `*tmp*` &lt;- x x &lt;- `names&lt;-`(`*tmp*`, `[&lt;-`(names(`*tmp*`), 2, &quot;two&quot;)) rm(`*tmp*`) We can dig into the source code, but the jist is that in order to implement these complex assignments: Copy x into a temporary variable *temp* [&lt;-(names(*tmp*), 2, &quot;two&quot;) modifies the second element of the names of *temp*, names&lt;-(*tmp* assigns step 2 to *temp* names Clean up by removing the temp variable 6.8.6.3 Exercise This question is flagged as “started” let’s try to complete it! Q: Explain why the following code fails: r modify(get(&quot;x&quot;), 1) &lt;- 10 #&gt; Error: target of assignment expands to non-language object A: First, let’s define x and recall the definition of modify() from the textbook: x &lt;- 1:3 `modify&lt;-` &lt;- function(x, position, value) { x[position] &lt;- value x } R internally transforms the code and the transformed code reproduces the error above. get(&quot;x&quot;) &lt;- `modify&lt;-`(get(&quot;x&quot;), 1, 10) #&gt; Error in get(&quot;x&quot;) &lt;- `modify&lt;-`(get(&quot;x&quot;), 1, 10) : #&gt; target of assignment expands to non-language object The error occurs during the assignment, because no corresponding replacement function, i.e. get&lt;- exists for get(). To confirm this we can reproduce the error via the following simple example. get(&quot;x&quot;) &lt;- 2 #&gt; Error in get(&quot;x&quot;) &lt;- 2 : target of assignment expands to non-language object I don’t really see why this needs to be expanded upon….

The working environment is the environment whose names would currently mask names in any other environment. Note that in the book, the term current environment is used not working environment. At any given time there is an environment that is most immediately-visible i.e. its names will mask the same names in any other environment. This is the current environment. The identity of the current environment can change e.g. when entering a function. It is often the case that the current environment is the global environment i.e. typically when working interactively. Are functions the only mechanism for changing the current environment? (I believe the answer is yes.) Consider the following from the book: The current environment, or current_env() is the environment in which code is currently executing. When you’re experimenting interactively, that’s usually the global environment, or global_env(). The use of the word “usually” in this sentence raises the possibility that there’s an exception. That exception could possibly mean There’s a way to change the environment in interactive mode without going into a function You can experiment interactively within a function or Something I’m ignorant of. I know that you can step-through a function in the debug browser so maybe that’s what he means? But then the very next line in the text says: The global environment is sometimes called your “workspace”, as it’s where all interactive (i.e. outside of a function) computation takes place. It both i) defines interactive specifically to exclude the inside of a function and ii) makes a stronger claim, “all interactive computation” vs “usually”. If you put a breakpoint or browser() call inside a function, then you would be working interactively in a function environment. Does hierarchy of environments have a computer science name (linked list?)? The hierarchy of environments is not a linked list, it is a directed graph. Clarification: the global environment’s parent is all the packages loaded within the environment, not the empty environment, right? How do we check this? parent.env(global)? Each package becomes a parent to the global environment. We can inspect local enviornments using search_envs() search_envs() ## [[1]] $ &lt;env: global&gt; ## [[2]] $ &lt;env: package:openintro&gt; ## [[3]] $ &lt;env: package:rlang&gt; ## [[4]] $ &lt;env: package:cyclocomp&gt; ## [[5]] $ &lt;env: package:lobstr&gt; ## [[6]] $ &lt;env: package:kableExtra&gt; ## [[7]] $ &lt;env: package:forcats&gt; ## [[8]] $ &lt;env: package:stringr&gt; ## [[9]] $ &lt;env: package:dplyr&gt; ## [[10]] $ &lt;env: package:purrr&gt; ## [[11]] $ &lt;env: package:readr&gt; ## [[12]] $ &lt;env: package:tidyr&gt; ## [[13]] $ &lt;env: package:tibble&gt; ## [[14]] $ &lt;env: package:ggplot2&gt; ## [[15]] $ &lt;env: package:tidyverse&gt; ## [[16]] $ &lt;env: package:stats&gt; ## [[17]] $ &lt;env: package:graphics&gt; ## [[18]] $ &lt;env: package:grDevices&gt; ## [[19]] $ &lt;env: package:utils&gt; ## [[20]] $ &lt;env: package:datasets&gt; ## ... and 3 more environments 7.2.4 Super assignment Let’s expand on the concept of super assignment x &lt;- 0 f &lt;- function() { x &lt;- 2 x &lt;&lt;- 1 x } f() ## [1] 2 x ## [1] 1 Note that the assignment inside f is local, but super assignment “never creates a variable in the current environment” so it modifies the global x and not the local x. If you want to break your brain a bit, check out: x &lt;- 0 f &lt;- function() { x &lt;- x x &lt;&lt;- x + 1 x } f() ## [1] 0 x ## [1] 1 f() ## [1] 1 x ## [1] 2 f() ## [1] 2 x ## [1] 3 7.2.5 Getting and setting “But you can’t use [[ with numeric indices, and you can’t use [:” It makes sense to me that you can’t use numeric indexes because objects in an environment aren’t ordered, but why can’t you use [? The solutions manual states: &quot;The second option would return two objects at the same time. What data structure would they be contained inside? [ returns an object of the same type, if we were to apply this to environments we’d have an environment returning an environment. 7.2.6 Advanced bindings Hadley mentions delayed bindings are used when autoloading datasets with packages - can we find an example of this? How is this different from including LazyData: true in your description file? The LazyData: true entry in DESCRIPTION just informs that delayed binding should be used. autoload does use delayed bindings [from source code: do.call(&quot;delayedAssign&quot;, list(name, newcall, .GlobalEnv, .AutoloadEnv))] but lazydata that gets used by packages is ultimately implemented as an internal function. If you scan through View(loadNamespace): if (file.exists(paste0(dbbase, &quot;.rdb&quot;))) lazyLoad(dbbase, env) dbbase &lt;- file.path(pkgpath, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;Rdata&quot;) if (file.exists(paste0(dbbase, &quot;.rdb&quot;))) lazyLoad(dbbase, .getNamespaceInfo(env, &quot;lazydata&quot;)) and lazyLoad eventually calls .Internal(makeLazy(vars, vals, expr, db, envir)) which leads you to https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/726bce63825844715860d35fdf76539445529f52/src/main/builtin.c#L103 and ultimately the delayed binding is realized as a promise with defineVar(name, mkPROMISE(expr0, eenv), aenv);. 7.3 Recursing over environments How can we re-write where so that it returns all functions with the same name? where2 &lt;- function(in_name, env = caller_env()) { all_functions &lt;- &quot;&quot; index &lt;- 1 while (!identical(env, empty_env())) { # if success if (env_has(env, in_name)) { all_functions[index] &lt;- env_name(env) index &lt;- index + 1 #return() } # inspect parent env &lt;- env_parent(env) } # base case - I&#39;m missing this I think return(all_functions) } # load dplyr so you have two filters library(dplyr) where2(&quot;filter&quot;) ## [1] &quot;package:dplyr&quot; &quot;package:stats&quot; We can also create a function that emulates pryr’s where: where3 &lt;- function(name, env = parent.frame(), found = character()) { if (identical(env, emptyenv())) return(found) else if (exists(name, env, inherits = FALSE)) { Recall(name, parent.env(env), c(found, environmentName(env))) } else { Recall(name, parent.env(env), found) } } where3(&quot;filter&quot;) ## [1] &quot;package:dplyr&quot; &quot;package:stats&quot; 7.3.1.2 Exercises I understood the recursion in the prior example, but what is inherits doing here? Can we go through this line for line and discuss what is happening in this function? fget &lt;- function(name, env = caller_env(), inherits = TRUE) { # Base case if (env_has(env, name)) { obj &lt;- env_get(env, name) if (is.function(obj)) { return(obj) } } if (identical(env, emptyenv()) || !inherits) { stop(&quot;Could not find function called \\&quot;&quot;, name, &quot;\\&quot;&quot;, call. = FALSE) } # Recursive Case fget(name, env_parent(env)) } # Test mean &lt;- 10 fget(&quot;mean&quot;, inherits = TRUE) ## function (x, ...) ## UseMethod(&quot;mean&quot;) ## &lt;bytecode: 0x7fa0526513b0&gt; ## &lt;environment: namespace:base&gt; Inherits is an argument that stops the function from performing the recursive action of looking into the parent environment for the name. Inherits is acting like a valve. If false, and the name wasnt found in the current environment, then stop because the next expression searches the parent of env. In the case environment is the empty environment then stop because the empty environment doesnt have a parent. 7.4.2 Function enviornment I found this section a little confusing. Can we go over the second figure in the section? Where does x live? g points to x but x is in the global enviornment? Can we come up with our own example for a function being bound to the global environment but accessing variables from its own enviornment? (I think this is what the second figure in the section is trying to display) y &lt;- 1 e &lt;- env() e$g &lt;- function() 1 e$g ## function() 1 This can be seen in our where2 example in the recursion section! 7.4.3 Namespaces “Every binding in the package environment is also found in the namespace environment; this ensures every function can use every other function in the package. But some bindings only occur in the namespace environment. These are known as internal or non-exported objects, which make it possible to hide internal implementation details from the user.” When you’re developing a package does the namespace environment just come with your package for free when you build it or you need to create both your package and its namespace env? How do you create functions that exist only in the namespace environment? When you are building the package, everything in the NAMESPACE file gets generated by roxygen2. Attaching a package puts the package in the search path of namespaces. So when you run library(package) or require(package) it creates the namespace environment. Package developers control what names are available by exporting to namespace (and otherwise you can call non-exported with :::). For example let’s say you want to extend forcats to use ordered factors to lump the tails. In order to get it to work, we need to use some forcats helper functions. We could just copy the code for the functions and added them to our scripts, but for prototyping it’s easy enough to just use ::: fct_lump_ordered &lt;- function(f, n, prop, q, w = NULL, other_level_low = &quot;Other Low&quot;, other_level_high = &quot;Other High&quot;, ties.method = c(&quot;min&quot;, &quot;average&quot;, &quot;first&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, &quot;random&quot;, &quot;max&quot;)) { f &lt;- check_ordered(f) w &lt;- forcats:::check_weights(w, length(f)) ties.method &lt;- match.arg(ties.method) levels &lt;- levels(f) if (is.null(w)) { count &lt;- as.vector(table(f)) total &lt;- length(f) } else { count &lt;- as.vector(tapply(w, f, FUN = sum)) total &lt;- sum(w) } if (all(missing(n), missing(prop), missing(q))) { lump &lt;- forcats:::in_smallest(count) lump &lt;- lump_range(!lump) new_levels &lt;- ifelse(lump == -1L,other_level_low, ifelse(lump == 1L, other_level_high, levels)) } else if (!missing(n) ) { if (n &lt; 0) { rank &lt;- rank(count, ties = ties.method) n &lt;- -n } else { rank &lt;- rank(-count, ties = ties.method) } if (sum(rank &gt; n) &lt;= 1) { return(f) } lump &lt;- lump_range(rank &lt;= n) new_levels &lt;- ifelse(lump == -1L, other_level_low, ifelse(lump == 1L, other_level_high, levels)) } else if (!missing(prop)) { prop_n &lt;- count/total if(prop &lt; 0) { lump &lt;- lump_range(prop_n &lt;= -prop) new_levels &lt;- ifelse(lump == -1L, other_level_low, ifelse(lump == 1L, other_level_high, levels)) } else { if (sum(prop_n &lt;= prop) &lt;= 1) { return(f) } lump &lt;- lump_range(prop_n &gt;= prop) new_levels &lt;- ifelse(lump == -1L, other_level_low, ifelse(lump == 1L, other_level_high, levels)) } } else if (!missing(q)) { cdf &lt;- cumsum(count)/sum(count) lump &lt;- lump_range(cdf &gt;= q[1] &amp; cdf &lt;= q[2]) new_levels &lt;- ifelse(lump == -1L, other_level_low, ifelse(lump == 1L, other_level_high, levels)) } if (other_level_low %in% new_levels &amp;&amp; other_level_high %in% new_levels) { f &lt;- forcats::lvls_revalue(f, new_levels) forcats::fct_relevel(f, other_level_low) forcats::fct_relevel(f, other_level_high, after = Inf) } else if (other_level_low %in% new_levels) { f &lt;- forcats::lvls_revalue(f, new_levels) forcats::fct_relevel(f, other_level_low) } else if (other_level_high %in% new_levels) { f &lt;- forcats::lvls_revalue(f, new_levels) forcats::fct_relevel(f, other_level_high, after = Inf) } else { f } How do conflicted packages identify duplicate function names and print them out We can use conflict_scout! conflicted::conflict_scout ## function (pkgs = NULL) ## { ## pkgs &lt;- pkgs %||% pkgs_attached() ## objs &lt;- lapply(pkgs, pkg_ls) ## names(objs) &lt;- pkgs ## index &lt;- invert(objs) ## potential &lt;- Filter(function(x) length(x) &gt; 1, index) ## unique &lt;- Map(unique_obj, names(potential), potential) ## conflicts &lt;- Filter(function(x) length(x) &gt; 1, unique) ## conflicts &lt;- map2(names(conflicts), conflicts, superset_principle) ## conflicts &lt;- map2(names(conflicts), conflicts, drop_moved) ## for (fun in ls(prefs)) { ## if (!has_name(conflicts, fun)) ## next ## conflicts[[fun]] &lt;- prefs_resolve(fun, conflicts[[fun]]) ## } ## conflicts &lt;- compact(conflicts) ## new_conflict_report(conflicts) ## } ## &lt;bytecode: 0x7fa05bdc52d0&gt; ## &lt;environment: namespace:conflicted&gt; 7.5 Call stacks What exactly is a frame? A frame is a singular step within the CST - in thr following example, f, g, and h are each frames f &lt;- function(x) { g(x = 2) } g &lt;- function(x) { h(x = 3) } h &lt;- function(x) { stop() } 7.6 Data Structures Can we discuss what’s happening in this function? Since it’s similar to the setwd function from last week could we build on this function to include on.exit()? my_env &lt;- new.env(parent = emptyenv()) my_env$a &lt;- 1 get_a &lt;- function() { my_env$a } set_a &lt;- function(value) { old &lt;- my_env$a my_env$a &lt;- value invisible(old) } We can use those two functions like we did getting and setting the work directory inside another function - using the old value within on.exit to reset my_env$a outside of the function: Hadley suggests returning invisible old so that you don’t need to explicitly call get_a, you can just assign the output of set_a set_a &lt;- function(value) { old &lt;- my_env$a my_env$a &lt;- value invisible(old) } do_thing_where_env_a_is_value(value, code) { myoldenv &lt;- set_a(value) # sets a to the NEW value and returns the OLD value for storage on.exit(set_a(myoldenv), add=TRUE) force(code) } The bullet point mentions hashmaps but I’m still really unclear on what that is. What are hash tables and are they related? They are sort of like fast look-up tables! It may be impossible to show with a small example. To demonstrate that the lookup is fast you’d need to store a lot of stuff in it first. You’d also probably need an alternative implementation of a lookup table to compare it to. We could probably implement a hash table relatively easily* using environments. Demonstrating that using environments is a good way to do it seems difficult. looking at a data structures textbook (Cormen, Lieserson &amp; Rivest), a hash table is expected to provide users with fast functions for insert, search, and delete.

It seems that try is just a wrapper for tryCatch and you can use it whenever you’d use try When would you actually use suppressWarning? Maybe when loading libraries? I created an example for suppressMessages, but does someone have a better, practical use case? As a function user, it’s common to suppress warnings when loading in data and using readr and dplyr - but not so much as a function creator 8.4.2 Exiting handlers tryCatch( message = function(cnd) &quot;There&quot;, { message(&quot;Here&quot;) stop(&quot;This code is never run!&quot;) } ) #&gt; [1] &quot;There&quot; The protected code is evaluated in the environment of tryCatch(), but the handler code is not, because the handlers are functions. Clarification question what is the “handler code” and “protected code”? The protected code is inside the {} and the handler code is message = function(cnd) &quot;There&quot; In the tryCatch example where we have finally print “Thank God for Beer” I find it interesting that this is printed before the code inside the tryCatch. Can anyone explain why? The handler code is evaluated prior to the protected code, that is why we see it second! 8.4.3 Calling handlers How would you define bubbling up? Bubbling up: By default, a condition will continue to propagate to parent handlers, all the way up to the default handler (or an exiting handler, if provided) I would consider what is being described there “bubbling up”. Why is this message executed once per message in the function? withCallingHandlers( message = function(cnd) cat(&quot;Caught a message!\\n&quot;), { message(&quot;Someone there?&quot;) message(&quot;Why, yes!&quot;) } ) #&gt; Caught a message! #&gt; Someone there? #&gt; Caught a message! #&gt; Why, yes! The following prints the message once: withCallingHandlers( message = function(cnd) cat(&quot;Caught a message!\\n&quot;), { warning(&quot;Someone there?&quot;) message(&quot;Why, yes!&quot;) } ) ## Warning in withCallingHandlers(message = function(cnd) cat(&quot;Caught a message! ## \\n&quot;), : Someone there? ## Caught a message! ## Why, yes! and it comes in the warning message, so it’s not really a “direct” print Oh wait, the handler code is named message, so is it possible that the two message calls in the protected block are actually calling both base::message and the message - named handler? The return value of a calling handler is ignored because the code continues to execute after the handler completes; where would the return value go? That means that calling handlers are only useful for their side-effects. Can we come up with an example for this masking? I think seeing it will help me understand… This just means that you cannot capture the return value of your handler (but you sort of can) f &lt;- function() { my_lovin &lt;- NULL withCallingHandlers( message = function(cnd) {my_lovin &lt;&lt;- &quot;not this time&quot;}, { never_ever_gunna_get_it = message(&quot;No, you&#39;re never gonna get it&quot;) } ) my_lovin } f() ## No, you&#39;re never gonna get it ## [1] &quot;not this time&quot; How does muffling differ from suppressWarnings? muffling allows for an over-ride/replacement of messages, while suppress just quiets everything: fn &lt;- function() { inform(&quot;Beware!&quot;, &quot;my_particular_msg&quot;) inform(&quot;On your guard!&quot;) &quot;foobar&quot; } Now we can use a new definition of my_particular_msg to replace “Beware” with_handlers(fn(), my_particular_msg = calling(function(cnd) { inform(&quot;Dealt with this particular message&quot;) cnd_muffle(cnd) }) ) ## Dealt with this particular message ## On your guard! ## [1] &quot;foobar&quot; whereas suppressMessages just returns foobar: suppressMessages(fn()) ## [1] &quot;foobar&quot; 8.4.5.2 Exercises In the example show_condition &lt;- function(code) { tryCatch( error = function(cnd) &quot;error&quot;, warning = function(cnd) &quot;warning&quot;, message = function(cnd) &quot;message&quot;, { code NULL } ) } The first three calls to show_condition make sense to me, and I even understand that the first time the code is evaluated inside a tryCatch it exists (that’s why it returns message) but how are you supplying 3 arguments to a function that just takes on one argument, code? Is that what the {} are for? show_condition({ 10 message(&quot;?&quot;) warning(&quot;?!&quot;) }) {} let us execute multiple lines of code! 8.4.5.3 Exercises I couldn’t follow the manual’s answer for what’s happening here, can we come up with our own answer for what’s happening here in words? withCallingHandlers( message = function(cnd) message(&quot;b&quot;), withCallingHandlers( message = function(cnd) message(&quot;a&quot;), message(&quot;c&quot;) ) ) ## b ## a ## b ## c The first call to withcallinghandlers adds a condition handler for conditions with class “message” to the handler stack (not sure if its actually a stack?) and then executes the second withcallinghandlers which adds another condition handler for conditions with class “message” to the handler stack (see above), and then executes the code message(&quot;c&quot;). What happens next is a chain reaction of handlers. The call message(&quot;c&quot;) is handled by the inner handler, which then calls message(&quot;a&quot;), but message(&quot;a&quot;) is caught by the outer handler, and so it outputs b first. Then the inner handler resolves itself and outputs a and then that condition (having not been muffled) “bubbles up” to the outer handler, which calls message(&quot;b&quot;) again producing the second b and again since the message wasn’t muffled, the original condition message(&quot;c&quot;) “bubbles up” to the top where it is evaluated producing the output c Another exercise: Guess the output of these two functions: i &lt;- 1 withCallingHandlers( message = function(cnd) {message(paste0(i, &quot;. b&quot;)); i &lt;&lt;- i+1}, withCallingHandlers( message = function(cnd) {message(paste0(i, &quot;. a&quot;)); i &lt;&lt;- i+1}, {message(paste0(i, &quot;. c&quot;))} ) ) ## 1. b ## 1. a ## 3. b ## 1. c i &lt;- 1 withCallingHandlers( message = function(cnd) {i &lt;&lt;- i+1; message(paste0(i, &quot;. b&quot;))}, withCallingHandlers( message = function(cnd) {i &lt;&lt;- i+1; message(paste0(i, &quot;. a&quot;))}, {message(paste0(i, &quot;. c&quot;))} ) ) ## 3. b ## 2. a ## 4. b ## 1. c 8.6.3 Resignal :::question Can we go over what is happening here? warning2error &lt;- function(expr) { withCallingHandlers( warning = function(cnd) abort(conditionMessage(cnd)), expr ) } warning2error({ x &lt;- 2 ^ 4 warn(&quot;Hello&quot;) }) Error: Hello The function warning2error captures an expression which is evaluated by withCallingHandlers where you have defined a handler for warning conditions. The handler captures the condition cnd raised by warn which is structure(list(message = &quot;Hello&quot;), class = c(&quot;warning&quot;, &quot;condition&quot;) The function conditionMessage is an s3 generic which evaluates to conditionMessage.condition which simply accesses cnd$message this is then the input to abort which raises an error with the message &quot;Hello&quot; 8.6.4 Record Why are we using cnd_muffle here? catch_cnds &lt;- function(expr) { conds &lt;- list() add_cond &lt;- function(cnd) { conds &lt;&lt;- append(conds, list(cnd)) cnd_muffle(cnd) } withCallingHandlers( message = add_cond, warning = add_cond, expr ) conds } catch_cnds({ inform(&quot;a&quot;) warn(&quot;b&quot;) inform(&quot;c&quot;) }) If we remove cnd_muffle we see that a, b, and c are printed to the console prior to getting the conds output. Would it be possible in the second Record example to create a function that doesn’t require us to put the abort statement at the end, just ignoring it? Or because abort is an exiting handler it needs to be last? catch_cnds &lt;- function(expr) { conds &lt;- list() add_cond &lt;- function(cnd) { conds &lt;&lt;- append(conds, list(cnd)) cnd_muffle(cnd) } tryCatch( error = function(cnd) { conds &lt;&lt;- append(conds, list(cnd)) }, withCallingHandlers( message = add_cond, warning = add_cond, expr ) ) conds } catch_cnds({ abort(&quot;a&quot;) inform(&quot;b&quot;) warn(&quot;c&quot;) }) I’m not positive, but I don’t think so without mucking around in the C code. You “can” using try instead of tryCatch, but I can’t think of a way to have it let you try each line in your passed in expression for example What is signal and what is it doing here? log &lt;- function(message, level = c(&quot;info&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, &quot;fatal&quot;)) { # if we remove match.arg and just use level # the signal returns infoerrorfatal as a single string # we need match.arg to find the selected level # and it defaults to the first if none are selected level &lt;- match.arg(level) signal(message, &quot;log&quot;, level = level) } Signal is a general function that calls abort, inform or warn. It has the same signature as those functions except for the class argument that is necessary for signal but NULL by default for each of the others signal &lt;- function(message, class, ..., .subclass) { if (!missing(.subclass)) { deprecate_subclass(.subclass) } message &lt;- collapse_cnd_message(message) cnd &lt;- cnd(class, ..., message = message) cnd_signal(cnd) } If you create a condition object by hand, and signal it with signalCondition(), cnd_muffle() will not work. Instead you need to call it with a muffle restart defined, like this: withRestarts(signalCondition(cond), muffle = function() NULL) Where does this code go given the prior example? We would replace the code cnd_muffle(cnd): ignore_log_levels &lt;- function(expr, levels) { withCallingHandlers( log = function(cnd) { if (cnd$level %in% levels) { # cnd_muffle(cnd) withRestarts(signalCondition(cnd), muffle = function() NULL) } }, expr ) } record_log(ignore_log_levels(log(&quot;Hello&quot;), &quot;warning&quot;)) [info] &quot;Hello&quot; 8.6.6.2 Exercises Calling handlers are called in the context of the call that signaled the condition. Exiting handlers are called in the context of the call to tryCatch(). What exactly does this mean? tryCatch evaluates what we were calling the protected code first and calling handlers execute the handling code first? Can we make a simple example? tryCatch is a project manager who oversees everything and then personally hands over the end product withCallingHandlers writes some procedures/guidelines and assumes everyone has enough information to get their jobs done Comparing: f &lt;- function() g() g &lt;- function() h() h &lt;- function() message(&quot;!&quot;) withCallingHandlers(f(), message = function(cnd) { lobstr::cst() cnd_muffle(cnd) }) ## █ ## 1. ├─base::withCallingHandlers(...) ## 2. ├─global::f() ## 3. │ └─global::g() ## 4. │ └─global::h() ## 5. │ └─base::message(&quot;!&quot;) ## 6. │ ├─base::withRestarts(...) ## 7. │ │ └─base:::withOneRestart(expr, restarts[[1L]]) ## 8. │ │ └─base:::doWithOneRestart(return(expr), restart) ## 9. │ └─base::signalCondition(cond) ## 10. └─(function (cnd) ... ## 11. └─lobstr::cst() withCallingHandlers is run to completion before f is called/put onto the stack.

So the message handler returns a value to the environment where f() is a meaningful call. Exiting handlers are called in the context of the call to tryCatch(). The exiting handler returns to an ongoing tryCatch() so it can do whatever it needs to do. 8.6.6.4 Exercises There’s no way to break out of the function because we’re capturing the interrupt that you’d usually use! What does this mean? You can’t stop the function if you set an interrupt argument inside a tryCatch? That’s exactly it - this was a warning not to use inturrupt in your functions! Slides What environment(s) these restarts are called within, or if that even applies or matters Given this little example: # low level function # if text isn&#39;t correct then abort with class malformed_text is_correct &lt;- function(text) { print(&#39;parent in low: &#39;); print(env_parent()) print(&#39;current in low: &#39;); print(env_parent()) if (text != &quot;CORRECT&quot;) { msg &lt;- paste0(text, &quot; needs to be &#39;CORRECT&#39;&quot;) abort( &quot;malformed_text&quot;, message = msg, text = text ) } return(text) } # medium level function # apply low level function to all text in a list # if it doesn&#39;t pass give it the restart skip_text # which will change that entry to NA replace_not_correct &lt;- function(all_text) { # f &lt;- function(x) { print(current_env()); is_correct(x) } lapply(all_text, function(text) { withRestarts( # f(text), { print(&#39;parent in mid: &#39;) ; print(env_parent()); print(&#39;current in mid: &#39;); print(current_env()); is_correct(text) }, skip_text = function(e){ NA; print(&#39;parent in mid skip: &#39;); print(env_parent()); print(&#39;current in mid skip: &#39;); print(current_env())} ) }) } # res &lt;- replace_not_correct(list(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;)) # res &lt;- replace_not_correct(list(&#39;CORRECT&#39;, &#39;A&#39;)) # res # high level function # if you have an error of type malformed_text, # use the restart from the midlevel function analyze_text &lt;- function(all_text) { withCallingHandlers( malformed_text = function(e) invokeRestart(&quot;skip_text&quot;), lapply(all_text, replace_not_correct) ) } analyze_text(list(&quot;CORRECT&quot;, &quot;NOT&quot;, &quot;CORRECT&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;parent in mid: &quot; ## &lt;environment: 0x7fa0599e47e8&gt; ## [1] &quot;current in mid: &quot; ## &lt;environment: 0x7fa0599e4040&gt; ## [1] &quot;parent in low: &quot; ## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## [1] &quot;current in low: &quot; ## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## [1] &quot;parent in mid: &quot; ## &lt;environment: 0x7fa0599f3390&gt; ## [1] &quot;current in mid: &quot; ## &lt;environment: 0x7fa05bafe350&gt; ## [1] &quot;parent in low: &quot; ## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## [1] &quot;current in low: &quot; ## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## [1] &quot;parent in mid skip: &quot; ## &lt;environment: 0x7fa05bafe350&gt; ## [1] &quot;current in mid skip: &quot; ## &lt;environment: 0x7fa05a6795c8&gt; ## [1] &quot;parent in mid: &quot; ## &lt;environment: 0x7fa05a67baa8&gt; ## [1] &quot;current in mid: &quot; ## &lt;environment: 0x7fa05a67f248&gt; ## [1] &quot;parent in low: &quot; ## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## [1] &quot;current in low: &quot; ## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## [[1]] ## [[1]][[1]] ## [1] &quot;CORRECT&quot; ## ## ## [[2]] ## [[2]][[1]] ## &lt;environment: 0x7fa05a6795c8&gt; ## ## ## [[3]] ## [[3]][[1]] ## [1] &quot;CORRECT&quot; So, the parent environment of the handler (is that the right term?) called skip_text in the mid-level function is the environment of the expr part of withRestarts (i.e. the first parameter), also in the mid-level function. Are there any default restarts include in base R so that you could invokeRestart(&quot;XXX&quot;) or is the restart always user defined? XXX Let’s revisit my example from the talk: can we build on this to use tidyeval so that the user can write beer_states %&gt;% beer_mean(state) [I think we need to use .data and note how state is given as an object so we need to use tidyeval to suppress it’s evaluation…] beer_states &lt;- readr::read_csv( &#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-31/beer_states.csv&#39;) beer_mean &lt;- function(.data, x) { column_name &lt;- deparse(substitute(x)) msg &lt;- glue::glue(&quot;Can&#39;t calculate mean, {column_name} is not numeric&quot;) if (!is.numeric(.data[[column_name]])) { abort( message = msg, arg = column_name, data = .data ) } else { mean(which(!is.na(.data[[column_name]])[.data[[column_name]]])) } } beer_states %&gt;% beer_mean(barrels) [1] 806.4551 "]
