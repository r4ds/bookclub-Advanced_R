# S4

## 15.2 Basics {-}

:::question
Broadly, what is a generic and method in S4 and what is their relationship? 


```r
setClass("Person", 
  slots = c(
    name = "character", 
    age = "numeric"
  )
)

setGeneric("age", function(x) standardGeneric("age"))
setGeneric("age<-", function(x, value) standardGeneric("age<-"))

setMethod("age", "Person", function(x) x@age)
setMethod("age<-", "Person", function(x, value) {
  x@age <- value
  x
})

john <- new("Person", name = "John Smith", age = 12)
age(john)
```

```
[1] 12
```

:::

A generic is a function that will dispatch differently based on the class it is applied to. Above we apply the `age` generic to `Person` using `setMethod` but we could create an `age` method that behaves differently for another class, like dogs (which will add 7 to the supplied age)


```r
setClass("Person", slots = c(name = "character",age = "numeric"))

setGeneric("age", function(x) standardGeneric("age"))
setGeneric("age<-", function(x, value) standardGeneric("age<-"))

setMethod("age", "Person", function(x) x@age)
setMethod("age<-", "Person", function(x, value) {
  x@age <- value
  x
})

setClass("Dog", slots = c(name = "character",  age = "numeric"))

# You want the age generic to automatically return 7x the slot in human years
setMethod("age", "Dog", function(x) {x@age*7} ) 
setMethod("age<-", "Dog", function(x, value) {
  x@age <- value
  x
})


spot <- new("Dog", name = "Spot Smith", age = 12)
age(spot)
```

```
[1] 84
```

:::question
What is `standardGeneric` doing in the example above?
:::

Itâ€™s the same thing as `UseMethod` but for S4

## 15.3.6.2 Exercises {-}

:::question
What is a virtual class and how does it relate to `setClassUnion` [see `?setClass`]
:::

A virtual class is a class that cannot be instanciated. Rather than define two of the same methods for two classes, give them both a virtual parent class with the shared method. 

## Signature {-}

:::question
In our own words what exactly is a signature? Are there any signatures within our `Person` example? If not can we add one?
