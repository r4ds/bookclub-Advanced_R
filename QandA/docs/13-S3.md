# S3



## 13.2 Basics {-}

:::question
What's a real use case for `unclass`?
:::

I wanted to pass a paletteer palette to `leaflet::colorNumeric` which ends up calling the S3 method `leaflet:::toPaletteFunc` but that only has methods defined for character function and matrix . The paletteer output is a character vector with class color and so `colorNumeric(palette, domain)` failed. Simple solution: `colorNumeric(unclass(palette), domain)`


## 13.3 Classes {-}

:::question
Can we come up with a simple example for a `constructor`, `validator`, and `helper`?
:::

#### IPA Constructor {-}

Create the custom class


```r
new_ipa <- function(x = double()) {
  structure(x, class = "ipa")
}
```

#### IPA Validator {-}

Function to make sure you can use your custom class


```r
validate_ipa <- function(x = double()) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
  # has to be at least 15 bitterness
  stopifnot(x >= 15)
  x
}
```

### IPA Helper {-}

Calls both the validator and the constructor


```r
ipa <- function(x) {
  x <- as.numeric(x)
  # Both helper and valditor
  x <- new_ipa(x)
  res <- validate_ipa(x)
  res
}
```

#### Test it out!

Fails as expected:


```r
ipa(5)
```

```
Error in validate_ipa(x) : x >= 15 is not TRUE
```

But this works!


```r
ipa(50)
```

```
## [1] 50
## attr(,"class")
## [1] "ipa"
```

## 13.3.4.4 Exercises {-}

:::question
Now that we've gone through the source code, I don't see where the contrasts attibute comes into play? We can look at the `C()` function but where is this used within `factor()`?
:::

It is a little misleading to say that factors "have an ... attribute", where I really think he means that "some functions might check if that attribute has been assigned".


Make a factor:


```r
f <- factor(c(1,2))
f
```

```
## [1] 1 2
## Levels: 1 2
```

Set contrasts attribute:


```r
f <- C(f)
f
```

```
## [1] 1 2
## attr(,"contrasts")
##       unordered 
## contr.treatment 
## Levels: 1 2
```



```r
f <- factor(f)
f
```

```
## [1] 1 2
## Levels: 1 2
```

dang't where did those contrasts go!

## 13.4.1 Generics {-}

:::question
In the example: 


```r
my_new_generic <- function(x) {
  UseMethod("my_new_generic")
}
```

The book states: "If you wonder why we have to repeat my_new_generic twice, think back to Section 6.2.3"

Can we go over why?
:::

I think heâ€™s referring to the fact that you have to use a string representation inside the UseMethod call.

I'm guessing part of the answer to this is baked into this warning on the UseMethod function docs:

> Warning: Prior to R 2.1.0 UseMethod accepted a call with no arguments and tried to deduce the generic from the context.

Basically, you're specifying the name of the function and then telling R to go find this generic function's methods. You can't self-reference the name of the generic after it's been assigned to itself?

Maybe the name doesn't exist!


```r
test.default <- function() {
  "test"
}

# not sure why you would want to do this, but you can
(function() {
  UseMethod("test")
})()
```

```
## [1] "test"
```

Also because you might have assigned your generic to a new name, how would it know to use the true "generic" name.


```r
superuglygenericfunction <- function() {
  UseMethod("superuglygenericfunction")
}

superuglygenericfunction.default <- function() {
  "ugh"
}

nice <- function() {
  UseMethod("superuglygenericfunction")
}

nice()
```

```
## [1] "ugh"
```

```r
#> [1] "ugh"
```


## 13.4.4.5 Exercises {-}

:::question
Can we explain what's happening here in our own words I was a little confused with the solutions manual? `g(x)` uses 1 from the `.default` method but `10` from the generic? Why?
:::


```r
g <- function(x) {
  x <- 10
  y <- 10
  UseMethod("g")
}

g.default <- function(x) c(x = x, y = y)

x <- 1
y <- 1
g(x)
```

```
 x  y 
 1 10 
```

UseMethod creates a new function call with arguments matched as they came in to the generic. Any local variables defined before the call to `UseMethod` are retained (unlike S).

When you call `g(x)` even though you appear to be ignoring it in your definition of `g` and assigning `x <- 10`, when you call `UseMethod` it will basically match the `x` in the `g.default` formals to the `x` that was passed in. The `y` isn't matched to any argument and is retained.

Tyler Grant Smith:m:  13 minutes ago
 r
g <- function(x) {
  x <- 10
  y <- 10
  UseMethod("g")
}
g.default <- function(x = NULL) c(x = x, y = y)
x <- 1
y <- 1
# this is interesting behavior
g()
#>  y 
#> 10
g(x)
#>  x  y 
#>  1 10

## 13.5 Object styles {-}

:::question
> Unfortunately, describing the appropriate use of each of these object styles is beyond the scope of this book. 

Can we use the `vctrs` package in a concrete example to address some of these fringe cases and reasons why `length(x)` is causing an issue?
:::

An object style is a pattern for structuring your class. You can use any structure you want but these 4 patterns get used very often. Date and factor are both vector style for example: the core data for objects of both types are stored in a single vector. And there are some other context-appropriate things denoted by attributes in each case.

I don't think length is an issue but when you move away from the vanilla vector style object then the meaning changes. For example, under the hood, a data frame is really a list of vectors. Each of the vectors (columns) has the same length. So if you take the length of a data frame you get the length of the list i.e. the number of columns.


```r
length(mtcars)
```

```
## [1] 11
```

The result of calling `length` on a data.frame isn't necessarily intuitive: most people would probably say that the number of rows is a more natural value for the length of a data frame.

This is the same for dates: which are actually of length `3` when classes and `9` when unclassed.


```r
x <- as.POSIXlt(ISOdatetime(2020, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1:3))
length(x)
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
length(unclass(x))
```

```
## [1] 11
```

## 13.6 Inheritance {-}

:::question
Can we make our own example of a method with inheritance?
:::

Creating an IBU calculator for beer, we can use the `.ipa` method for a beer of class `.wipa`:


```r
library(sloop)

# IBUs are calculated as onces x alpha acid x boil time / constant
# we're going to use a different constant for IPAs and Stouts


# generic
IBU_calculator <- function(x) {
  UseMethod("IBU_calculator")
}

# default
IBU_calculator.default <- function(x){
  stop("Can only calculate IBU for beers, not ",class(x))
}

# ipa
IBU_calculator.ipa <- function(x) {
  1 * x * 30 / 7.25
}

# stout
IBU_calculator.stout <- function(x) {
  1.5 * x * 30 / 6
}

#### some beers ####
ipa_1 <- structure(
  15, class = c("ipa","beer")
)

# define a wine to see default dispatch
wine_1 <- structure(3,class = c("pinot","wine"))

# wipa "inherits" class ipa so we can use that method!
wipa_1 <- structure(20, class = c("wipa","ipa","beer"))

## 13.7.1 S3 and Base Types {-}

:::question
WHY isn't the dispatch of mean(x1) determined by its type???
:::


```r
x1 <- 1:5
class(x1)
```

```
[1] "integer"
```


```r
s3_dispatch(mean(x1))
```

```
   mean.integer
   mean.numeric
=> mean.default
```


```r
methods(mean)
```

```
## [1] mean.Date     mean.default  mean.difftime mean.POSIXct  mean.POSIXlt 
## [6] mean.quosure*
## see '?methods' for accessing help and source code
```

mean doesn't actually have a specific method defined in base R for int or numeric. the default method handles all base types, type checking along the way:


```r
mean.default
```

```
## function (x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...) 
## {
##     if (!is.numeric(x) && !is.complex(x) && !is.logical(x)) {

##     }
##     if (na.rm) 
##         x <- x[!is.na(x)]
##     if (!is.numeric(trim) || length(trim) != 1L) 
##         stop("'trim' must be numeric of length one")
##     n <- length(x)

##         lo <- floor(n * trim) + 1
##         hi <- n + 1 - lo
##         x <- sort.int(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))[lo:hi]
##     }
##     .Internal(mean(x))
## }

## 13.7.3 Internal Generics {-}

:::question
> Defining a single group generic for your class overrides the default behaviour for all of the members of the group.

Does this mean that if I define abs for my class it overrides the behaviour of sign, sqrt and all the others in the Math group?
:::

Essentially, these are all (loosely) math-related functions, so R understands how to do these for anything it can understand as a numeric (somehow). If you're adding a class that isn't handled in one of these numeric-ish ways, you'll need to tell R how to handle the mathematics. You can't make a group like "Math", "Ops", "Summary", or "Complex" and expect R to know what it's doing.

If you define `abs` for your class it won't know how to do the other things. Suppose you defined your own `min.POSIXct` then when you call `min(Sys.time())` it will encounter your function, evaluate, and then that is the end.  Otherwise, min would call the min Primitive which is implemented in C [as found here](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/bf4cf8912596162a3ae5a2b7da1a74220105b172/src/main/summary.c#L520) and if you trace through that you will see that is where the `GroupDispatch` is called.

## 13.7.4 Double Dispatch {-}

:::question
What is happening here:

```r
Ops.foo <- function(...)  print("Called twice for some reason?")
x <- structure(2, class = "foo")
x > 0
```

```
[1] "Called twice for some reason?"
[1] "Called twice for some reason?"
```
:::

Double dispatch -- where itâ€™s calling the same method on x and zero. The inequality needs to convert both to the same class.

:::question
The book mentions that we can use `vctrs::vec_arith` to avoid the aboce, but does that pertain to this case? I tried: `vctrs::vec_arith(">", x, 0)` But I think my understanding is still off...
:::

The `vec_arith` generic will first dispatch on `class(x)` So, in this case it tries to find `vec_arith.foo` but we haven't defined that yet, so it instead finds `vec_arith.default` which signals the error.


```r
x <- structure(2, class = "foo")
x > 0
```

```
[1] TRUE
```


```r
vec_arith(">", x, 0) 
```

```
Error: <foo> > <double> is not permitted
vec_arith will dispatch to this first, because it finds the "foo" generic
```


```r
vec_arith.foo <- function(op, x, y, ...) {
  # now it will dispath on y, which in this case is a numeric.
  UseMethod("vec_arith.foo", y)
}
vec_arith(">", x, 0) 
```

```
Error in UseMethod("vec_arith.foo", y): no applicable method for 'vec_arith.foo' applied to an object of class "c('double', 'numeric')"
```

Uh oh another error, and this is super confusing because none of our objects are class double.  (typeof(x) is "double"). The problem is that vec_arith.foo further dispatches on the second argument and it is looking for `vec_arith.numeric` or `vec_arith.default`, but we haven't defined that yet.


```r
vec_arith.foo.numeric <- function(op, x, y, ...) {
  vctrs::vec_arith_base(op, x, y, ...)
}
vec_arith(">", x, 0)
```

```
[1] TRUE
```


```r
vec_arith(">", 0, x)
```

```
Error: <double> > <foo> is not permitted
```

now vec_arith will first dispatch on the 0 and scope to vec_arith.numeric which will then try to dispatch to vec_arith.numeric.foo which we havent defined yet.


```r
vec_arith.numeric.foo <- function(op, x, y, ...) {
  vctrs::vec_arith_base(op, x, y, ...) 
}
vec_arith(">", 0, x)
```

```
[1] FALSE
```
