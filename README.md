# R4DS [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) Bookclub

This repo contains 4 main folders:

- Exercises: The official Advanced R exercises from https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/, 
rather than copy all the answers we'll use this space to answer the questions that have yet to be answered!
These markdown documents follow the styling/conventions of the book to streamline if we wanted 
to submit any PRs.

- QandA: Questions about the chapters that come up during meetings (or between!).
We can use this document to ask and answer questions within and outside of class

- Presentations: each week a presenter will give a talk tying the chapter to the XXX dataset.
We will also be recording these presentations for those who cannot attend.

- data: The dataset we will be using for presentations
