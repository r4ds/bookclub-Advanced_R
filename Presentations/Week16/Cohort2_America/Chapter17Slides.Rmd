# Outline

- Metaprograming Introduction

- Code Is Data and also a `r emo::ji("evergreen tree")`?! `r emo::ji("exploding head")`

- Evaluation of Code

- Intro To Quosures

---

##Prerequisites

- We will use **rlang** to introduce the user-friendly/tidy versions of the main methods in metaprogramming.

- The **lobstr** package is used to understand the structure of R code. 

```{r eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
library(rlang)
library(lobstr)
```

```{r echo = F, fig.retina = 3 }
knitr::include_graphics("img/lobster_edit_for_web_jpg.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F,message = FALSE,}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

---

## What is Metaprogramming?

- The idea is that code is data that can be inspected and modified programmatically.

- Ex: Why we don't need to quote packages in `library()` or can write formulas in `glm()` with `+, *, :`

- We will focus on Tidy Eval rather than base R functions, this is to avoid some of R's ambiguous legacy code.


---

## Non-Standard Programing

- What is Non-Standard Programing (NSE)? Very roughly, it is to programmatically modify an expression or its meaning after it is issued but before it is executed.

- Example: how R knows to use "`hp > 250`" on our data frame at run time rather that the traditional `mtcars[mtcars$hp > 250,c("mpg","hp")]` method where we have to link `mtcars` to `hp`.

```{r}
subset(mtcars%>%dplyr::select(mpg,hp), hp > 250)
```

- Hadley opines that NSE is a sloppy definition for this behavior, so we will generally avoid this terminology in these chapters.

- R is one of the few languages that allows as much flexibility and accessibility for NSE. Python is jealous.


---

## Why use Metaprogramming?

- The ability to modify the meaning of code given context or inputs is extremely powerful

- This allows us to use many of the key features in the Tidyverse

- R does it by design, so why not use its full power?

```{r echo = F, fig.retina = 3 }
knitr::include_graphics("img/more-power-scotty.png")
```

---

## Code is Data: Expressions

- We can capture code and compute on it like other types of data

- Captured code is called an *Expression*, we use `rlang::expr()` to do this.

```{r}
expr(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- An expression can be one of 4 types of objects: 
  - calls (representing captured functions)
  - symbols (names of an object)
  - scalar constants (length 1 atomic vectors)
  - pairlists (legacy version of lists used to store the arguments of a function)

---

## Code is Data: Enriching!

- Most often we want to deal with code passed through a function, this will not work with `expr()`.

```{r}
capture_it <- function(x) {
  expr(x)
}
capture_it(a + b + c)
```


- To capture code through a function call, where there is lazy evaluation, we need to use **enriched** expressions: `enexpr()`.

```{r}
capture_it <- function(x) {
  enexpr(x)
}
capture_it(a + b + c)
```


---

## Code is Data: Inspect or Modify

- Once we have captured code, we can interact with it like most data objects

- Inspection:

```{r}
f <- expr(f(x = 1, y = 2))
f[[2]]
f$x
```


- Modification:

```{r}
f$z <- 3
f
```


---

## Code is Data: And `r emo::ji("evergreen tree")`'s!

- Most programming language represents code as a tree, often called the **abstract syntax tree**.

- To view the tree structure we use `lobstr::ast()`. This function displays the underlying tree structure. Function calls form the branches of the tree and the leaves are symbols and constants.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(f(a, "b"))
```

- This works for all types of functions including the prefix form.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(1 + 2 * 3)
```


---

## Code is Data: Code Generator

- We can use code to create new trees. There are two main tools: `rlang::call2()` and **unquoting**.

- `call2()` constructs a function call from its components: first the function to call, and then the arguments to call it with.

```{r}
call2("+", 1, 2)
call2("+", 1, call2("*", 2, 3))
```

---

## Code is Data: !! 

- `call2` can be cumbersome for complex operations, an alternative is to build complex code trees by combining simpler code trees with a template. `expr()` and `enexpr()` have built-in support for this idea via `!!`, the *unquote operator*.

- Unquoting allows you to selectively evaluate parts of the expression that would otherwise be quoted, which effectively allows you to merge ASTs using a template AST. 

- Basically !!x inserts the code tree stored in x into the expression.

```{r}
xx <- expr(x + x)
yy <- expr(y + y)
expr(!!xx / !!yy)
```

---

## Code is Data: !! Cont.

- Unquoting is even more useful when wrapped it up into a function. 

- First we using `enexpr()` to capture the user’s expression, then `expr()` and `!!` to create a new expression using a template.

```{r}
cv <- function(var) {
  var <- enexpr(var)
  expr(sd(!!var) / mean(!!var))
}
cv(x+y)
```

- Capturing (also known as quoting) and unquoting together make up **Quasiquotation**. 

- Quasiquotation makes it easy to create functions that combine code written by the function’s author with code written by the function’s user.

---


## Evaluation: How to Evaluate 

- We can create, modify, and inspect code... what if we want to run it?

- We can do that too with `base::eval()`. 

- Evaluating code relies on an expression and an environment to give the symbols definition.

```{r}
  eval(cv(x+y),  env(x=rnorm(1000,0,1),y=rnorm(1000,0,1)))
```


 - One advantage of evaluating code manually is that you can define the environment. There are two main reasons to do this:

    - To temporarily override functions to implement a domain specific language.
   
    - To add a data mask.

- A data mask is an environment containing user-supplied objects. Objects in the mask have precedence over objects in the environment (i.e. they mask those objects).

---

## Evaluation: Custom with Functions

- In our last example we bound the names `x` and `y` to random vectors of length 1000. As we saw in Chapter 6, we also bind names to functions.

- This allows us to override the behaviour of existing functions.

```{r}
string_math <- function(x) {
  e <- env(
    caller_env(),
    `+` = function(x, y) paste0(x, y),
    `-` = function(x, y) gsub(y, "", x),
    `*` = function(x, y) strrep(x, y)
  )
  eval(enexpr(x), e)
}

What <- "Power!"
string_math("More " + What)
string_math(("xyz" - "y") * 3)
```

---

## Evaluation: Custom with Data 

-  Another application is modifying evaluation to look for variables in a data frame instead of an environment. This idea powers `ggplot2::aes()` and `dplyr::mutate()`. 

- It’s possible to use `eval()` for this, but this is less user friendly and can be restricting, so we’ll switch to `rlang::eval_tidy()` instead.

- The main differences with `eval_tidy()` are that it takes an expression, environment and a **data mask** to reduce ambiguity.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = rep(1,5))
eval_tidy(expr(x + y), df, env(x=11:15))
```
- To ensure we are using the data mask when we mean to, `eval_tidy` provides us with the pronouns: `.data` and `.env` to use in our expressions.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = rep(1,5))
eval_tidy(expr(.env$x + y), df, env(x=11:15))
```


---

## Quosures

- We can see an issue with our environments in the below example. We would like the value of `a` to be the one that is visible to the user (10), not internal to the function (1000).

```{r}
with2 <- function(df, expr) {
  a <- 1000
  eval_tidy(enexpr(expr), df)
}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3)
a <- 10
with2(df, x + a)
```

- We can solve this by using a **quosure**, which bundles an expression with an environment. 

- The name is a portmanteau of quoting and closure, because a quosure both quotes the expression and encloses the environment. 

- Quosures solidifies the internal promise object into something that you can program with.

---

## Quosures Cont.

- `eval_tidy()` is designed to use quosures, just replace the expression and do not supply an environment in the call.

```{r}
with2 <- function(df, expr) {
  a <- 1000
  eval_tidy(enquo(expr), df)
}

with2(df, x + a)
```

- When using a data mask it is best practice to use a quosure.

---

## Summary

- Metaprogramming lets us modify code after definition and before evaluation

- Captured code = Expressions and they act like data (Chapter 18)

- Quasiquotation allows us to interactively generate code (Chapter 19)

- Evaluation allows for customization (Chapter 20)
