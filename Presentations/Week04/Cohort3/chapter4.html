# Introduction 
- Interrelated concepts to internalise:
  + There are 3 subsetting operators:  `[[`, `[`, and `$`
  
  + Subsetting operators interact differently with various vector types (e.g. atomic vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames)
  
  + Subsetting and assignment can be combined ("subsassignment")
  
&gt; Subsetting complements structure, or `str()`, which shows you *all* the pieces of an object, but subsetting lets you pull out only the pieces you are interested in.
  
&gt; Often useful to use RStudio Viewer, with `View(my_object)` to know which pieces you want to subset

# 4.2: Selecting multiple elements

---
class: middle
# Subsetting atomic vectors
&gt; Use `[` to select any number of elements from a vector.

--

Assume we have a simple vector: `x &lt;- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)`



+  Positive integers return elements at the specified positions:

```r
x[c(3, 1)]
```

```
## [1] 3.3 2.1
```
+  Negative integers exclude elements at the specified positions:

```r
x[-c(3, 1)]
```

```
## [1] 4.2 5.4
```
---
class: middle
# Subsetting atomic vectors

+  Logical vectors select elements where the corresponding logical value is `TRUE`

```r
x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```

```
## [1] 2.1 4.2
```

```r
x[x &gt; 3]
```

```
## [1] 4.2 3.3 5.4
```
&gt;  `x[c(TRUE, FALSE)]` is equivalent to `x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]`

+  Nothing returns the original vector.

```r
x[]
```

```
## [1] 2.1 4.2 3.3 5.4
```
---
class: middle
+  Zero returns a zero-length vector.

```r
x[0]
```

```
## numeric(0)
```
+ Named vector

```r
(y &lt;- setNames(x, letters[1:4]))
```

```
##   a   b   c   d 
## 2.1 4.2 3.3 5.4
```

```r
y[c("d", "c", "a")]
```

```
##   d   c   a 
## 5.4 3.3 2.1
```

# Subsetting lists

* Subsetting a list works in the same way as subsetting an atomic vector.
* Using `[` always returns a list

* `[[` and `$`, as described in *Section 4.3*, let you pull out elements of a list.

#  Subsetting matrices and arrays

&gt; The most common way of subsetting matrices (2D) and arrays (&gt;2D) is a simple generalisation of 1D subsetting 

#### Subset with multiple vectors.

```r
a &lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
colnames(a) &lt;- c("A", "B", "C")
```
.pull-left[

```r
a[1:2, ]
```

```
##      A B C
## [1,] 1 4 7
## [2,] 2 5 8
```
]

.pull-right[

```r
a[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  c("B", "A")]
```

```
##      B A
## [1,] 4 1
## [2,] 6 3
```
]
---
#  Subsetting matrices and arrays
Consider the matrix below:

```r
(vals = matrix(1:25, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE))
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]    1    2    3    4    5
## [2,]    6    7    8    9   10
## [3,]   11   12   13   14   15
## [4,]   16   17   18   19   20
## [5,]   21   22   23   24   25
```

.pull-left[
####*Subset with a single vector*

```r
vals[c(4, 15)]
```

```
## [1] 16 23
```
]

.pull-right[
#### *Subset with a matrix*

```r
select &lt;- matrix(ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE, c(
  1, 1,
  3, 1,
  2, 4
))
vals[select]
```

```
## [1]  1 11  9
```
]

# Subsetting data frames and tibbles
+ Data frames have the characteristics of both lists and matrices.

+ When subsetting with a single index, they behave like lists and index the columns, so `df[1:2]` selects the first two columns.

+ When subsetting with two indices, they behave like matrices, so `df[1:3, ]` selects the first three rows (and all the columns

&gt; Given `df &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 3:1, z = letters[1:3])` what is the output for:&lt;br&gt; 
`df[df$x == 2, ]`,&lt;br&gt; `df[c("x", "z")]`, &lt;br&gt; `df[, c("x", "z")]`,&lt;br&gt;  `str(df["x"])`, and &lt;br&gt;`str(df[, "x"])`?

---
# Preserving dimensionality

&gt; By default, subsetting a matrix or data frame with a single number, **a single name**, or **a logical vector** containing a single `TRUE`, will simplify the returned output, i.e. it will return an object with lower dimensionality.

&gt; To preserve the original dimensionality, you must use `drop = FALSE`

.pull-left[
####*For matrices and arrays, any &lt;br&gt; dimensions with length 1 will &lt;br&gt;be dropped:*

```r
a &lt;- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2)
str(a[1, ])
```

```
##  int [1:2] 1 3
```

```r
str(a[1, , drop = FALSE])
```

```
##  int [1, 1:2] 1 3
```
]

.pull-right[
####*Data frames with a single column &lt;br&gt; will return just that column*

```r
df &lt;- data.frame(a = 1:2, b = 1:2)
str(df[, "a"])
```

```
##  int [1:2] 1 2
```

```r
str(df[, "a", drop = FALSE])
```

```
## 'data.frame':	2 obs. of  1 variable:
##  $ a: int  1 2
```
]

# 4.3: Selecting a single element
&gt; There are two other subsetting operators: `[[` and `$`.&lt;br&gt; `[[` is used for extracting single items, while `x$y` is a useful shorthand for `x[["y"]]`

---
class: middle
# Use of `[[`

+ Primary use case for `[[` is when working with lists, as you get a list back.
  
  &gt; If list x is a train carrying objects, then `x[[5]]` is the object in car `5`; `x[4:6]` is a train of cars `4-6`.— @RLangTip
  

```r
x &lt;- list(1:3, "a", 4:6)
```

---
# Use of `[[`
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="img/train.png" width="60%" /&gt;

&lt;img src="img/train-single.png" width="60%" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---
# Use of `[[`
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="img/train.png" width="60%" /&gt;

&lt;img src="img/train-many.png" width="60%" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

+ If you use a vector with `[[`, it will subset recursively, i.e. `x[[c(1, 2)]]` is equivalent to `x[[1]][[2]]`.
---
class: middle
# Use of `$`

+ `$` is a shorthand operator: `x$y` is roughly equivalent to `x[["y"]]`. 
+ Often used to access variables in a data frame, as in mtcars$cyl or diamonds$carat. 
+ One common mistake with `$` is to use it when you have the name of a column stored in a variable:
&gt; If `var &lt;- "cyl"`, `mtcars$var` doesn't work because it is translated to `mtcars[["var"]]`. Instead use `mtcars[[var]]`

---
# Use of `$`

+ The one important difference between `$` and `[[` is that `$` does (left-to-right) partial matching.


```r
x &lt;- list(abc = 1)
x$a
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
x[["a"]]
```

```
## NULL
```

+ You can avoid this behaviour:


```r
options(warnPartialMatchDollar = TRUE)
x$a
```

```
## [1] 1
```

&gt; **Remember:** For data frames, you can also avoid this problem by using tibbles, which never do partial matching.

---
class: middle
# Using @ and slot()

+ Two additional subsetting operators, which are needed for S4 objects: 
  1. `@` (equivalent to `$`)
  2. `slot()` (equivalent to `[[`). 
  
&gt; `@` is more restrictive than `$` in that it will return an error if the slot does not exist.

# 4.4: Subsetting and assignment

Subassignment: Combining subsetting operators with assignments to modify selected values in an input vector.

The basic form is `x[i] &lt;- value`

Ensure that:

- `length(value)` == `length(x[i])`


```r
# wafanyikazi$new_var &lt;- 1:10000

# Error in `$&lt;-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, new_var, value = 1:10000) : 
  #replacement has 10000 rows, data has 500
```

- `i` is unique

---

To remove a component, use `x[[i]] &lt;- NULL`


```r
departments &lt;- list("data", "operations", "finance")
departments
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "data"
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "operations"
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] "finance"
```

```r
departments[[3]] &lt;- NULL
departments
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "data"
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "operations"
```



To add a literal NULL, use `x[i] &lt;- list(NULL)`


```r
departments[3] &lt;- list(NULL)
departments
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "data"
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "operations"
## 
## [[3]]
## NULL
```

##4.5.1 Lookup tables (character subsetting)
Character matching


```r
x &lt;- c("m", "f", "u", "f", "f", "m", "m")

lookup &lt;- c(m = "Male", f = "Female", u = NA)

lookup[x] ## Is this the same as saying look for x in the vector lookup? Is it also the same as using an ifelse function? 
```

```
##        m        f        u        f        f        m        m 
##   "Male" "Female"       NA "Female" "Female"   "Male"   "Male"
```

We can exclude names in the results using:


```r
unname(lookup[x])
```

```
## [1] "Male"   "Female" NA       "Female" "Female" "Male"   "Male"
```

---
##4.5.2 Matching and merging by hand (integer subsetting)


```r
grades &lt;- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 1)

info &lt;- data.frame(
  grade = 3:1,
  desc = c("Excellent", "Good", "Poor"),
  fail = c(F, F, T)
)

head(info)
```

```
##   grade      desc  fail
## 1     3 Excellent FALSE
## 2     2      Good FALSE
## 3     1      Poor  TRUE
```

Assuming we want to duplicate the info table so that we have a row for each value in grades. 

`match(needles, haystack)` // look for (needles, haystack)
---

What is the position of the needles [grades elements : (1,2,2,3,1)] in the haystack [info$grade: (3,2,1)]



```r
id &lt;- match(grades, info$grade)
id
```

```
## [1] 3 2 2 1 3
```

```r
info[id, ]
```

```
##     grade      desc  fail
## 3       1      Poor  TRUE
## 2       2      Good FALSE
## 2.1     2      Good FALSE
## 1       3 Excellent FALSE
## 3.1     1      Poor  TRUE
```

When matching on multiple columns, you will need to first collapse them into a single column (with e.g `interaction()`). 


```r
## insert intersection code here
```

But dplyr{} `*_join()` functions would be your best friends at this point
---
##4.5.3 Random samples and bootstraps (integer subsetting)

Using integer indices to randomly sample or bootstrap a vector or data frame.

Use `sample(n)` to generate a random permutation of `1:n`, and then use the results to subset the values

Simulate a dataframe


```r
df = data.frame(names = c("John", "Teresa", "Shel", "Christine", "Brenda"),
                gender = c("M", "F", "F", "F", "F"),
                rshp = c("Father", "Mother", "Self", "Sister", "Sister"))
df
```

```
##       names gender   rshp
## 1      John      M Father
## 2    Teresa      F Mother
## 3      Shel      F   Self
## 4 Christine      F Sister
## 5    Brenda      F Sister
```

---

Reorder the dataframe randomly


```r
df[sample(nrow(df)), ]
```

```
##       names gender   rshp
## 1      John      M Father
## 5    Brenda      F Sister
## 4 Christine      F Sister
## 3      Shel      F   Self
## 2    Teresa      F Mother
```

Select two random rows


```r
df[sample(nrow(df), 2), ]
```

```
##    names gender   rshp
## 5 Brenda      F Sister
## 3   Shel      F   Self
```

Select 7 bootstrap replicates


```r
df[sample(nrow(df), 7, replace = T), ]
```

```
##      names gender   rshp
## 5   Brenda      F Sister
## 3     Shel      F   Self
## 5.1 Brenda      F Sister
## 3.1   Shel      F   Self
## 3.2   Shel      F   Self
## 1     John      M Father
## 1.1   John      M Father
```

---
##4.5.4 Ordering (integer subsetting)

`order()` takes a vector as its input and returns an integer vector describing how to order the subsetted vector


```r
fam &lt;- c("John", "Teresa", "Shel", "Christine", "Brenda")

order(fam) ## orders alphabetically (in ascending order by default)
```

```
## [1] 5 4 1 3 2
```

```r
fam[order(fam)]
```

```
## [1] "Brenda"    "Christine" "John"      "Shel"      "Teresa"
```

```r
## We can also order the vector in ascending order

fam[order(fam, decreasing = T)]
```

```
## [1] "Teresa"    "Shel"      "John"      "Christine" "Brenda"
```

_NB: By default, any missing values will be put at the end of the vector; however, you can remove them with `na.last = NA` or put them at the front with `na.last = FALSE`._


```r
# us &lt;- c("Me", "You", NA)
# us[order(us)]
# us[order(us, na.last = FALSE)]
```

---

Using `order()` to order values in a variable, or variables themselves, in a dataframe


```r
# Randomly reorder df
df2 &lt;- df[sample(nrow(df)), 3:1]
df2
```

```
##     rshp gender     names
## 4 Sister      F Christine
## 2 Mother      F    Teresa
## 3   Self      F      Shel
## 1 Father      M      John
## 5 Sister      F    Brenda
```

```r
# Order by one variable
df[order(df$gender), ]
```

```
##       names gender   rshp
## 2    Teresa      F Mother
## 3      Shel      F   Self
## 4 Christine      F Sister
## 5    Brenda      F Sister
## 1      John      M Father
```
---


```r
# Order the variables themselves
df[, order(names(df))]
```

```
##   gender     names   rshp
## 1      M      John Father
## 2      F    Teresa Mother
## 3      F      Shel   Self
## 4      F Christine Sister
## 5      F    Brenda Sister
```

_You can sort vectors directly with `sort()`, or similarly `dplyr::arrange()`, to sort a data frame._
---
##4.5.5 Expanding aggregated counts (integer subsetting)


```r
df &lt;- data.frame(x = c(2, 4, 1), y = c(9, 11, 6), n = c(3, 5, 1))
df
```

```
##   x  y n
## 1 2  9 3
## 2 4 11 5
## 3 1  6 1
```

```r
rep(1:nrow(df), df$n)
```

```
## [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3
```

```r
df[rep(1:nrow(df), df$n), ]
```

```
##     x  y n
## 1   2  9 3
## 1.1 2  9 3
## 1.2 2  9 3
## 2   4 11 5
## 2.1 4 11 5
## 2.2 4 11 5
## 2.3 4 11 5
## 2.4 4 11 5
## 3   1  6 1
```

---
##4.5.6 Removing columns from data frames (character )

Method 1: Set individual columns to NULL


```r
df = data.frame(names = c("John", "Teresa", "Shel", "Christine", "Brenda"),
                gender = c("M", "F", "F", "F", "F"),
                rshp = c("Father", "Mother", "Self", "Sister", "Sister"))
df
```

```
##       names gender   rshp
## 1      John      M Father
## 2    Teresa      F Mother
## 3      Shel      F   Self
## 4 Christine      F Sister
## 5    Brenda      F Sister
```

```r
## create a copy of the dataframe
df2 &lt;- df

## drop a column
df2$gender &lt;- NULL
df2
```

```
##       names   rshp
## 1      John Father
## 2    Teresa Mother
## 3      Shel   Self
## 4 Christine Sister
## 5    Brenda Sister
```

---

Method 2: Subset to return only the columns you want


```r
df[c("names", "rshp")]
```

```
##       names   rshp
## 1      John Father
## 2    Teresa Mother
## 3      Shel   Self
## 4 Christine Sister
## 5    Brenda Sister
```

Method 3: Use set operations to work out which columns to keep. This is useful when you only know the columns that you don't want. 


```r
to_keep &lt;- setdiff(names(df), "gender")
to_keep
```

```
## [1] "names" "rshp"
```

```r
df[to_keep]
```

```
##       names   rshp
## 1      John Father
## 2    Teresa Mother
## 3      Shel   Self
## 4 Christine Sister
## 5    Brenda Sister
```

---
##4.5.7 Selecting rows based on a condition (logical subsetting)


```r
library(rChambua)
head(wafanyikazi, n=3)
```

```
##     Sid Gender Age       Department   Role Income Marital_Status  County

**De Morgan’s laws:**

- `!(X &amp; Y)` is the same as `!X | !Y`

- `!(X | Y)` is the same as `!X &amp; !Y`

##4.5.8 Boolean algebra versus sets (logical and integer )

Two types of subsetting.

- integer subsetting: (set operations)
  - Effective when you want to find the first (or last) TRUE and
  
  - You have very few TRUEs and very many FALSEs; a set representation may be faster and require less storage.

- logical subsetting: (Boolean algebra)

`which()` allows you to convert a Boolean representation to an integer representation.


```r
which(df$names %in% "John")
```

```
## [1] 1
```

You can create a function that does the reverse i.e. converts an integer representation to a Boolean representation.

Do we really need to do this?


```r
unwhich &lt;- function(x, n) {
  out &lt;- rep_len(FALSE, n)
  out[x] &lt;- TRUE
  out
}
unwhich(which(df$names %in% "John"), length(df$names))
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

When we can just do this?


```r
df$names %in% "John"
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

---

## Relationship between Boolean and set operations.

Create two logical vectors (x1 , y1) and their integer equivalents (x2, y2)

```r
(x1 &lt;- 1:10 %% 2 == 0)
```

```
##  [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```

```r
(x2 &lt;- which(x1))
```

```
## [1]  2  4  6  8 10
```

```r
(y1 &lt;- 1:10 %% 5 == 0)
```

```
##  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
```

```r
(y2 &lt;- which(y1))
```

```
## [1]  5 10
```

---

### X &amp; Y &lt;-&gt; intersect(x, y)

```r
x1 &amp; y1
```

```
##  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
```

```r
intersect(x2, y2)
```

```
## [1] 10
```

--
### X | Y &lt;-&gt; union(x, y)


```r
x1 | y1
```

```
##  [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```

```r
union(x2, y2)
```

```
## [1]  2  4  6  8 10  5
```

---
### X &amp; !Y &lt;-&gt; setdiff(x, y)


```r
x1 &amp; !y1
```

```
##  [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

```r
setdiff(x2, y2)
```

```
## [1] 2 4 6 8
```

--

### xor(X, Y) &lt;-&gt; setdiff(union(x, y), intersect(x, y))



```r
xor(x1, y1)
```

```
##  [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

```r
setdiff(union(x2, y2), intersect(x2, y2))
```

```
## [1] 2 4 6 8 5
```

# Exercises

* How would you randomly permute the columns of a data frame? (This is an important technique in random forests.) Can you simultaneously permute the rows and columns in one step?

```r
# Read in the data
df &lt;- rChambua::wafanyikazi
head(df1, n=3)
```

* How would you select a random sample of m rows from a data frame? What if the sample had to be contiguous (i.e., with an initial row, a final row, and every row in between)?

--


```r
# Generate a vector of the first and last row ids
first_last_ids &lt;- c(1,nrow(df))
first_last_ids
```

```
## [1]   1 500
```

--

```r
# Sample m (2) rows from the dataframe, excluding the first and last rows
original_ids &lt;- 1:nrow(df)

other_ids &lt;- sample(original_ids[!original_ids %in% first_last_ids] , 2)
other_ids
```

```
## [1] 289 488
```

--

```r
# Combine the first, last and the rows in between
final_ids &lt;- c(first_last_ids[1], other_ids, first_last_ids[2])
final_ids
```

```
## [1]   1 289 488 500
```

---

```r
# Call the data, with only these specific rows
df3 &lt;- df[final_ids,]
df3
```

```
