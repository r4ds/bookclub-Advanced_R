# Introduction & Key Points
  
  + There are 6 ways to subset atomic vectors (more in 4.2 & 4.3)
  
  + There are 3 subsetting operators:  [[, [, and $
  
  + Subsetting operators interact differently with various vector types (e.g. atomic vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames)
  
  + Subsetting and assignment can be combined ("subsassignment")
  
  + Subsetting complements structure, or `str()`, which shows you *all* the pieces of an object, but subsetting lets you pull out only the pieces you are interested in
  
  + Often useful to use RStudio Viewer, with `View(my_object)` to know which pieces you want to subset

---
  
# Selecting Multiple Elements
  
  + Use `[` to select any number of elements from a vector (of any type), in one of 6 ways
  
  + We will use the following vector (from the beer dataset) in the examples
  
```{r eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
library(dplyr)
brewer_size <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-31/brewer_size.csv')
brewers <- brewer_size %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(sum = sum(n_of_brewers), barrels = sum(total_barrels)) %>%
  select(sum, barrels) %>%
  c()
n_brewers <- brewers$sum
n_barrels <- brewers$barrels
n_brewers
n_barrels

```

---

# Selecting Multiple Elements:  Approaches 1 & 2

  + **Positive integers** return elements at the specified position(s).

```{r eval=T}
n_brewers[2] # Can also be used for a single element
n_brewers[c(1,11,12)] # Note what happens with out of bounds index
n_brewers[4:6]

```

  + **Negative integers** *exclude* elements at the specified position(s).

```{r eval=T}
n_brewers[-11] # Omits the last (11th) value
n_brewers[c(-1:-5)] # Omits the first 5 values
```
NOTE:  You can't mix positive and negative integers in a subset

---

# Selecting Multiple Elements:  Approaches 3 & 4

  + **Logical vectors** select elements where the corresponding logical value is true.  Perhaps the most useful type of subsetting.

```{r eval=T}
n_brewers[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
n_brewers[n_brewers > 10000]
n_brewers[n_brewers > 4000 & n_brewers < 9000]
n_brewers[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)] # Usual recycling rules apply
```

  + **Nothing** returns the original vector.  Useful for matricies, data frames, and arrays (later).

```{r eval=T}
n_brewers[]
```

  + More useful with matrices, data frames, and arrays.
  
---

# Selecting Multiple Elements:  Approaches 5 & 6

  + **Zero** return returns a zero length vector.  Useful for generating test data.

```{r eval=T}
n_brewers[0]

```

  + Helpful for generating test data

  + **Character vectors** return elements of vectors *with names*.

```{r eval=T}
nb <- setNames(n_brewers, letters[1:11])
nb[c("a", "b", "c")]
nb[c("b", "b")] # Can repeat indices

```

  + Recommendation is to not subset with factors
  
---

#  Selecting Multiple Elements of Lists, Matrices, and Arrays

  + For Lists, it's the same as for an atopmic vector
  
    + `[` always returns a list; `[[` and `$` let you pull out elements (later)
    
  + For **matrices** and **arrays**, there are 3 ways:
  
    + With multiple vectors
    + With a single vector
    + With a matrix
    
```{r eval=T}
A <- matrix(n_brewers[1:10], nrow = 2)
A
A[1,] # To select first row
A[,2:3] # To select 2nd and 3rd columns
A[2,4] # Can also select a single element
```   

---

# Selecting Multiple Elements of Data Frames

  + Data frames have characteristics of both lists and matrices, so:
  
    + When subsetting with a single index, they behave like lists.
    + When subsetting with two indices, they behave like matrices.
    
```{r eval=T}
B <- data.frame(year = 2009:2013, num = n_brewers[1:5], prod = n_barrels[1:5])
B[1:2] # Selects first two columns
B[2,] # Selects the second row
B[4,2] # Select a single element
str(B["year"]) # list subsetting does not simplify
str(B[, "year"]) # matrix subsetting simplifies by default
```   

---

# Selecting Multiple Elements of Tibbles


+ Subsetting a tibble with `[` always returns a tibble.

```{r eval=T, results='hold'}
C <- tibble::tibble(B)
C[2,] # Selects the second row
C[4,2] # Select a single element
str(C["year"]) # Same as next
str(C[,"year"]) # Same as previous
```

---

# Preserving Dimensionality

  + Subsetting a matrix or data frame with a single number will (by default) simplify the returned output to an object with lower dimensionality

  + You can change this with `drop = FALSE`.
  
  + Tibbles default to `drop = FALSE` because the default `drop = TRUE` behavior is a common source of bugs in functions.
  
  + Factor subsetting is different; it affects levels (not dimensions) and defaults to `FALSE`.
  
  + If you are using `drop = TRUE` a lot, you shoudl probably use a character vector instead of a factor.

```{r eval=T}
str(A[1,])
str(A[1, , drop = FALSE])

```

---

# Selecting a single element

+ Two subsetting operators

  + `[[` is used for extracing single elements

  + `$` is just shorthand operator, i.e. x$y is the same as x[["y"]] (in 5 fewer keystrokes)
  
  + Primary use case for `[[` is when working with lists, as you get a list back.
  
  + The "train of cars" example is useful in illustrating the difference between `[` and `[[`.
  
```{r eval=T}
x <- list(1:3, "a", 4:6)
```


```{r echo=F, include=T, eval=T, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('train.png')
```

```{r echo=F, include=T, eval=T, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('train-single.png')
```

---

# More on `[[`

  + `[[` can only return a single item, so you can only use it with a single positive integer or a single string.
  
  + If you use a vector with `[[`, it will subset recursively.
  
    + This means that `x[[c(1,2)]]` is equivalent to `x[[1]][[2]]`
    
  + You have to use `[[` when workign with lists, but it is recommended for extracting a single value from atomic vectors too.
  
  + For somethign like this, it probably doesn't matter.

```{r eval=T}
n_brewers[7]
n_brewers[[7]]
```

  + But in code like this, somehow it does?

```{r eval=F}
for (i in 2:length(x)) {
  out[i] <- fun(x[i], out[i-1])
}

for (i in 2:length(x)) {
  out[[i]] <- fun(x[[i]], out[[i-1]])
}

```

---

# Now about `$`

  + As mentioned, it is a shortcut, with `x$y` being *roughly equivalent* to x[["y"]].
  
  + Often used to access variables in data frames.
  
  + A common mistake is using it when the name of a column is stored in a variable.
  
  + An important difference betweeen `$` and `[[` is that `$` does partial (left to right) matching.
  
  + A common mistake with `$` is using it when you have the name of a column stored in a variable

```{r eval=T}
# Tried to put an example here with the beer data set but ran out of time
# and refused to use the mtcars example from the book.  Will add in later.

```

---

# Missing and Out-of-Bounds Indices

  + What happens when you use an "invalid" index with `[[`?
  
  + Inconsistencies in this table led to the development of `purr::pluck()` and `purr::chuck`().
  
```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
xyz <- matrix(c("Atomic", rep("Error",4), "List", rep("Error",2), rep("NULL",7)), nrow=3)
colnames(xyz) <- c("row[[col]]", "Zero-length", "OOB(int)", "OOB(chr)", "Missing")
kableExtra::kable(xyz, caption = "Table from 4.3.3")
```

---

# @ and `slot()` Operators

  + These operators are needed for S4 objects (covered in Chap. 15)
  
  + @ is the equivalent of $; @ is more restrictive
  
  + `slot()` is the equivalent to `[[`
  
  
---

# Subsetting and Assignment ("Subassignment")

  +All subsetting operators can be combined with assignment to modify selected values of the input vector.
  
```{r eval=T}
n_brewers
n_brewers[5] <- 42
n_brewers[c(1,2)] <- c(1.618, 186282)
n_brewers

```
  
  + Be sure that the length(value) is the same length of x[i] due to complex recycling rules.
  
---
  
# Application - Lookup Tables
###Character Subsetting

  + Character matching can be used to create lookup tables.
    
  + You can use `unname()` to remove the names if you want

```{r eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
brewing_materials <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-31/brewing_materials.csv')
types <- substring(brewing_materials$type[1:15],1,1)
types
lookup <- c(M = "Malt", C = "Corn", R = "Rice", B = "Barley", W = "Wheat", T = "Total", S= "Sugar", H = "Hops", O = "Other")
lookup[types]

unname(lookup[types])

```
    
---
  
# Application - Matching and Merging By Hand
### Integer Subsetting

  + Can have more complicated lookup tables with multiple columns.
    
  + You can use `unname()` to remove the names if you want

```{r eval=T, warning=F, message=F}

grades <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 1)
info <- data.frame(
  grade = 3:1,
  desc = c("Excellent", "Good", "Poor"),
fail = c(F, F, T)
)
id <- match(grades, info$grade)
id
info[id, ]

```

---
  
# Application - Random Samples and Bootstraps
### IntegerSubsetting

  + Can use integer indices to randomly sample or bootstrap a vector or data frame using `sample()`.

```{r eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
B <- data.frame(year = 2009:2013, num = n_brewers[1:5], prod = n_barrels[1:5])
B

# Randomly reorder
B[sample(nrow(B)), ]

```
      
---
  
# Application - Random Samples and Bootstraps (cont.)
### Integer Subsetting

  + Can use integer indices to randomly sampel or bootstrap a vector or data frame using `sample()`.

```{r eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
# Select 3 randow rows
B[sample(nrow(B), 2), ]

#Select 10 bootstrap replicates
B[sample(nrow(B), 10, replace = TRUE), ]
# The number after decimal indicates additional occurrences

```
    
---
  
# Application - Ordering
### Integer Subsetting

  + Provide a vector to `order()` and it returns an integer vector describing how to order the subsetted vector.

  + To break ties, you can supply additional variables to `order()`.


```{r eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
types
order(types)
types[order(types)]
types[order(types, decreasing = TRUE)] # Change order from ascending to descending

```

---
  
# Application - Ordering (cont.)
### Integer Subsetting

  + For two or more dimensions, `order()` makes it easy to order *either* the rows or columns of an object.

```{r eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
# Reorder by 'num' column
B[order(B$num), ]

# Reorder by names of columns
B[, order(names(B))]

```

---
  
# Application - Expanding Aggregated Counts
### Character Subsetting

  + Given a data frame where identical rows have been collapsed into one and a count column, use `rep()` and integer subsetting to uncollapse.
  
  + This works because `rep(x, y)` repeats `x[i] y[i]` times.
  
```{r eval=T}
df <- data.frame(x = c(2, 4, 1), y = c(9, 11, 6), n = c(3,5,1))
rep(1:nrow(df), df$n)

df[rep(1:nrow(df), df$n), ]
```

---

# Application - Removing Columns From Data Frames
### Character Subsetting

  + There are two ways to remove columns from a data frame.
    
    + You can set individual columns to `NULL`.
    
    + Or you can subset to return only the columns you want.

   + If you only know the columns you **don't** want, use set operations to work out which columns to keep:


```{r eval=T}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 3:1, z = letters[1:3])
df$z <- NULL

df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 3:1, z = letters[1:3])
df[c("x", "y")]

df[setdiff(names(df), "z")]

```

---
  
# Application - Selecting Rows Based on a Condition
### Logical Subsetting

  + To combine conditions from multiple columns use logical subsetting

```{r eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
B <- data.frame(year = 2009:2013, num = n_brewers[1:5], prod = n_barrels[1:5])
B[B$num >= 4000,]
B[B$num >= 4000 & B$year < 2013,]
```
    
---
  
# Application - Boolean Algebra vs Sets 
### Logical & Integer Subsetting

  + Using set operations is useful when:
    
    + You want to find the first (or last) `TRUE`.
    
    + You have very few `TRUE`s and very few `FALSE`s, so a set representation is faster and uses less storage
    
  + Use `which()` to convert a Boolean representation to an integer representation.
  
  + There is no reverse operation in base R, but it can be written like this:


```{r eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
x <- sample(10) < 4
which(x)

unwhich <- function(x, n) {
  out <- rep_len(FALSE, n)
  out[x] <- TRUE
  out
}

unwhich(which(x), 10)
```

---
  
# Application - Boolean Algebra vs Sets (cont.)
### Logical & Integer Subsetting

  + Here are two logical vectors and some operations useful in subsetting.
    
```{r eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
x1 <- 1:10 %% 2 == 0 # uses the mod operator `%%` to identify even numbers
x2 <- which(x1)
y1 <- 1:10 %% 5 == 0 # Finds numbers divisible by 5 with remainder 0
y2 <- which(y1)

x1 & y1 # gives the intersection
intersect (x2, y2) # check it this way; gives even numbers

x1 | y1 # gives the union
union(x2, y2) # provides even numbers and those divisible by 5

x1 & !y1 # gives even numbers *not* divisible by 5
setdiff(x2, y2) # check it this way
```
        
---
  
# Application - Boolean Algebra vs Sets (cont. cont.)
### Logical & Integer Subsetting

  + Common mistake is using `x[which(y)]` instead of `x[y]`.  Problem is that the `which()` switches from logical to integer subsetting but doesnt' really do anything here.  But it can make a difference:
  
    + When there is an `NA` in the logical vector, logical subsetting replaces them with `NA`, but `which()` drops these values.
    
    + `x[-which(y)]` is **not** equivalent to `x[!y]`
    
  + Bottom line:  avoid switching from logical to integer subsetting unless you really want to, like to find the first (last) `TRUE` value.
