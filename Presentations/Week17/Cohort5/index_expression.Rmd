## Intro

What if we want to run a defined code but don't actually have the input yet!

```{r}
try(Result <- a + b)
```
--
We need first to `capture` our code into an **Expression**, so it wont be executed straight away.

```{r}
(Expression <- rlang::expr(Result <- a + b))
```

--
The previous generated **Expression** can be evaluated (`eval`):
```{r}
a <- b <- 1
eval(Expression)
Result
```

## Expression and Evaluation Notes

- expr() and enquo() prevents evaluation (defusing, quoting)
  - enquo() defuses expressions supplied as argument by the user of a function
  - base: quote() and substitute()
- eval_tidy() evaluation of an saved expression
  - base: eval()

> The process by which a computer language takes a string and constructs an expression is called **parsing**, and is governed by a set of rules known as a **grammar.**

### Quosure

Quoted expression that includes a reference to the context where it was created.

```{r}
multiply_expr_by_10 <- function(expr) {
  expr       <- enquo(expr)
  local_ten  <- 10
  quo(!!expr * local_ten)
}
quo <- multiply_expr_by_10(a + b)
quo
eval_tidy(quo)
```

## ASTs Review

Package lobstr `ast`

```{r}
lobstr::ast(f(x, "y", 1))
```

RStudio TreeViewer

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(expr(f(x, "y", 1)))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/view_expression.png")
```

---
class: left, top

## ASTs Syntax

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lobstr::ast(f(g(1, 2), h(3, 4, i())))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9e269a7eb3509ae2e9f3fa9583ff2195b947cc53/d5886/diagrams/expressions/complicated.png")
```

- Evaluation from deepest-to-shallowest (not guaranteed)
- Abstract Syntax: white space and comments are ignored
  - exception: `y <- x` != `y < -x`

#### Inside - Out Example

```{r}
sum(10 * sum(1+1+1), mean(c((1+1), 4)))
```

- most operators are **left-associative**, i.e. the operations on the left are evaluated first (expections: exponentiation and assignment):


```{r}
lobstr::ast(1 + 2 + 3) # ( 1 + 2 ) + 3
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(
  tibble(
    operator = c(":: :::","$ @", "[ [[","^",
                 "- +",":","%any%","* /","+ -",
                 "< > <= >= == !=	", "!","& &&","| ||",
                 "~","-> ->>","<- <<-","=","?"
                 ),
    meaning = c(
      "access variables in a namespace",
      "component / slot extraction",
      "indexing",
      "exponentiation (right to left)",
      "unary minus and plus",
      "sequence operator",
      "special operators (including %% and %/%",
      "multiply, divide",
      "(binary) add, subtract",
      "ordering and comparison",
      "negation",
      "and",
      "or",
      "as in formulae",
      "rightwards assignment",
      "assignment (right to left)",
      "assignment (right to left)",
      "help (unary and binary)"
    ),
    associativity = c(
      "left-associative","left-associative","left-associative",
      "right-associative",
      "left-associative","left-associative","left-associative",
      "left-associative","left-associative","left-associative",
      "left-associative","left-associative","left-associative",
      "left-associative",
      "right-associative","right-associative","right-associative",
      "left-associative"
    )
  ) %>%  head(4)
)
```

## Infix Calls

- Does not matter how you write it: function or infix

```{r}
expr(y <- x * 10)
expr(`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10)))
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e32631051094207bc971e4352744db7ba6f8aac1/6f551/diagrams/expressions/prefix.png")
```

---
class: left, top

## Expression Data Types

- **constants**, expression of a constant is the same as outside of the expression

```{r}
expr(1) == 1
```

- **symbols**, represents name of an object

```{r}
x <- 1
expr(x) == sym("x")
expr(x) == x
# Reverse
rlang::as_string(expr(x))
```

---
class: left, top

## Calls

- **call object** represents a captured function call
  - type of list (pairlist to be precise)
  
```{r}
lobstr::ast(f(a = 1, b = 2))
```
```{r}
is.call(expr(f(a = 1, b = 2)))
```

---
class: left, top

## Manipulating Expressions

```{r}
x <- expr(f(a = 1, b = 2))
x[[1]]
x[[2]]
x$a <- 3
x
```

---
class: left, top

## Constructing

```{r}
call2("<-", expr(x), 10)
call2("mean", x = expr(x), na.rm = TRUE)
```

> Using call2() to create complex expressions is a bit clunky. Youâ€™ll learn another technique in Chapter 19.

## Parsing

```{r}
x1 <- "2 + 10"
eval(x1) # Eval wont work as it is still a string
(p1 <- rlang::parse_expr(x1)) # multiple expressions with parse_exprS
```

Base (returns Expression Vector, means it is not a list but a vector of expressions more or less the same):
```{r}
(p2 <- parse(text = x1))
```

```{r}
(eval(p1)) == (eval(p2))
```

---
class: left, top

## Deparsing

- given an expression, you want the string that would generate it

```{r}
z <- expr(1+2)
expr_text(z)
```

-  does happen when we print the expression automatically

```{r}
print(z)
```
