# What is metaprogramming?

--

Writing programs (or code) that can manipulate other programs (or code).

Does metaprogamming == __Non Standard Evaluation (NSE)__?

> [Metaprogramming] is the idea that code is data that can be inspected and modified programmatically... Closely related to metaprogramming is __non-standard evaluation__, NSE for short. This term, which is commonly used to describe the behaviour of R functions, is problematic.. NSE is actually a property of the argument (or arguments) of a function, so talking about NSE functions is a little sloppy.

# 1. R code is a tree


But what does that mean???

--

___"R code can be described as expressions, which can be drawn as trees."___

<!-- > Expressions are also called __abstract syntax trees (ASTs)__ because the structure of code is hierarchical and can be naturally represented as a tree.-->

> An expression is anything that has a value. The simplest expressions are literal values like the number 1, the string "stuff", and the Boolean TRUE. A variable like least is also an expression: its value is whatever the variable currently refers to. Complex expressions are built out of simpler expressions: `1 + 2` is an expression that uses `+` to combine 1 and 2, while the expression `c(10, 20, 30)` uses the function `c` to create a vector out of the values 10, 20, 30. Expressions are often drawn as trees.

--

```{r }
lobstr::ast(f(x, 'y', 1))
```

--

> Colours will be shown when you call `ast()`, but do not appear in the book for complicated technical reasons.

<!-- ASTs are not unique to R. However, R is somewhat unique because of how it provides users the freedom to manipulate the tree. -->

> Please note that whether you choose to explicitly build a parse tree or not, you will almost certainly have to write your parsing and executing function(s) using recursion. Fortunately, the recursion required to do this is super easy (whether you build a parse tree or not, the recursion is very natural).

> Implementing a Parse Tree is optional for Phase A. In Phase B, we will almost certainly mandate that you have a Parse Tree, and for Phase B, the parse trees are decidedly more complicated, since you will have both Expressions to represent and Statements to represent.
